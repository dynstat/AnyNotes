Below is a detailed explanation of how to approach several tree traversals using both recursive and iterative methods. We’ll discuss the ideas behind each traversal and then provide code examples with thorough inline comments.

> **Note:** In the examples below we assume a simple binary tree where each node has at least a “value” and optional “left” and “right” children. In our examples, such nodes are referenced as attributes (i.e. instance attributes) like `node.value`, `node.left`, and `node.right`.

## 1. Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)

### **Concept**

- **What It Does:**  
  Visits nodes level by level from left to right.

- **Recursive Approach:**  
  You first compute the height of the tree. Then, for each level (from 1 to the tree’s height), you print the nodes at that level using a helper that “drills down” the tree.  
  **Pros:** Simple logic to leverage recursive depth.  
  **Cons:** Not optimal because it repeatedly traverses parts of the tree (O(n²) in worst cases).

- **Iterative Approach:**  
  Uses a queue (usually via `collections.deque`) to track nodes in the order they should be processed. Each node’s children are enqueued so that nodes are processed level by level.  
  **Pros:** Processes every node only once (O(n)).

    Approach:
    1. Calculate the height of the tree.
    2. For each level from 1 to height, call a helper function to print that level.
    
    Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst-case skewed trees.
    Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursion stack.
    """
    def height(node):
        # Base case: If node is None, its height is 0.
        if node is None:
            return 0
        # Otherwise, height is 1 plus the maximum height of its children.
        return 1 + max(height(node.left), height(node.right))
    
    def print_level(node, level):
        # If current node is None, nothing to print.
        if node is None:
            return
        # If we have reached the target level, print the node's value.
        if level == 1:
            print(node.value, end=" ")
        # Otherwise, decrement the level and continue on both children.
        else:

    # Calculate the tree's height.
    h = height(root)
    for i in range(1, h+1):
        print_level(root, i)

    """

    Approach:

    Space Complexity: O(w) where w is the maximum width (number of nodes at a level).

    if not root:
        return

        # Enqueue right child if it exists.
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)

## 2. Zigzag (Spiral) Level Order Traversal

### **Concept**

- **What It Does:**  
  Traverses the tree level by level but alternates the direction on each level (left-to-right followed by right-to-left).

- **Recursive Approach:**  
  Similar to recursive level order but with a flag passed to the helper function to reverse the order on alternate levels.

- **Iterative Approach:**  
  Uses two stacks (or deques) to alternate the order. One stack holds the current level’s nodes, and the other collects nodes for the next level in an order based on a directional flag.

## 3. Vertical Order Traversal

### **Concept**

- **What It Does:**  
  Prints nodes that are in the same vertical (or column) order. We assign each node a horizontal distance (hd) from the root, subtracting one for a left child and adding one for a right child.

- **Recursive Approach:**  
  Uses depth-first search (DFS) and passes along the horizontal distance (and optionally the level) to group nodes in a dictionary keyed by hd.

- **Iterative Approach:**  
  Uses a breadth-first search (BFS) with a queue. Along with each node, the horizontal distance (and level) is tracked so that the nodes can be grouped for later sorting and printing.

### **Code Examples**

       - Level (depth) to keep top-to-bottom order.
    2. Save tuples (level, node.value) in a dictionary where the key is the hd.
    3. After traversal, sort the dictionary keys,
       and for each key, sort the list by level before printing.
    
    Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.

        traverse(node.left, hd-1, level+1)
        traverse(node.right, hd+1, level+1)
    
    if not root:
        return
    
    hd_dict = {}
    traverse(root, 0, 0)

## 4. Boundary Traversal

### **Concept**

- **What It Does:**  
  Prints the nodes forming the boundary (outline) of the tree in anti-clockwise order. This includes:
  1. **Left Boundary:** All nodes on the path from the root's left child down to the left-most node (excluding leaf nodes).
  2. **Leaf Nodes:** All nodes with no children (from left to right).
  3. **Right Boundary:** All nodes on the path from the root's right child down to the right-most node (excluding leaf nodes) are collected and then printed in reverse order.

- **Recursive Approach:**  
  Breaks the problem into three recursive functions:
  - One for traversing the left boundary.
  - One for printing all leaf nodes.
  - One for traversing the right boundary (printed in reverse order).

- **Iterative Approach:**  
  Uses loops (and sometimes a stack for DFS) to collect the left boundary, leaf nodes, and right boundary in separate lists. After that, it combines and prints them.

## **How to Think About These Iterative Conversions**

1. **Start from the Recursive Definition:**  
   - Write out (or imagine) how the recursive version works; note what parts of the recursion matter (e.g., visiting a node before/after its children).

2. **Determine What to Track:**  
   - For postorder (or any traversal that needs a node to be visited multiple times), use a "visited" flag, or structure (like two stacks in zigzag).  
   - For vertical order, track additional information (horizontal distance, level).

3. **Simulate the Call Stack with an Explicit Stack or Queue:**  
   - Each time you would recursively call a function, push the corresponding state (like the node, its hd, or even a flag) onto a stack or queue.
   - For level order and zigzag—use a queue or two stacks, respectively.

4. **Diagram the Tree:**  
   - Draw the tree on paper, label the levels or horizontal distances, and simulate the stack/queue operations step by step.

5. **Test on Simple Trees:**  
   - Check empty trees, trees with one node, and balanced trees so that you’re confident in your implementation.

# Mastering Recursion and Iteration: Dual Approaches to Problem Solving

Recursion and iteration are two fundamental programming paradigms used to solve problems. While recursion involves a function calling itself to break down a problem into smaller subproblems, iteration uses loops to repeat a set of instructions until a condition is met. Understanding both approaches offers flexibility and efficiency in problem-solving.

## Recursion vs. Iteration: An Overview

**Recursion** is a technique where a function solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. It typically involves a **base case** to terminate the recursion and a **recursive case** to break down the problem.

**Iteration** involves using loops (`for`, `while`, etc.) to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Iterative solutions are generally memory-efficient and can often be optimized better than recursive ones.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect            | Recursion                                       | Iteration                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Mechanism**     | Function calls itself repeatedly                | Uses looping constructs (`for`, `while`)      |
| **Memory Usage**  | Higher due to call stack                            | Lower, as it uses constant memory              |
| **Ease of Use**   | Intuitive for problems with inherent recursion | More efficient for simple repetitive tasks    |
| **Performance**   | Can be slower due to overhead of function calls | Generally faster due to lower overhead        |
| **Complexity**    | Can lead to stack overflow with deep recursion  | No risk of stack overflow                     |

Despite their differences, many problems can be solved using either approach. Mastery of both allows for optimized and flexible coding practices.

## Tree Traversals: Recursive and Iterative Methods

Tree traversals are fundamental operations on tree data structures. We'll explore how each traversal can be implemented using both recursion and iteration.

### Inorder Traversal

**Definition**: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root node, then traverse the right subtree.

#### Recursive Inorder Traversal

```python
# File: tree_traversals.py:path/to/tree_traversals.py

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def inorder_recursive(root):
    """
    Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree using recursion.
    Inorder Traversal Order: Left -> Root -> Right
    """
    if root:
        inorder_recursive(root.left)    # Traverse left subtree
        print(root.val, end=' ')        # Visit root
        inorder_recursive(root.right)   # Traverse right subtree

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Constructing the following Binary Tree:
    #         1
    #        / \
    #       2   3
    #      / \
    #     4   5

    root = TreeNode(1)
    root.left = TreeNode(2)
    root.right = TreeNode(3)
    root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
    root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

    print("Recursive Inorder Traversal:")
    inorder_recursive(root)  # Output: 4 2 5 1 3
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive Inorder Traversal:
4 2 5 1 3 
```

#### Iterative Inorder Traversal

```python
# File: tree_traversals.py:path/to/tree_traversals.py

def inorder_iterative(root):
    """
    Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree using iteration.
    """
    stack = []
    current = root

    while stack or current:
        while current:
            stack.append(current)          # Push current node to stack
            current = current.left         # Move to left child
        current = stack.pop()              # Pop node from stack
        print(current.val, end=' ')        # Visit node
        current = current.right            # Move to right child

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nIterative Inorder Traversal:")
    inorder_iterative(root)  # Output: 4 2 5 1 3
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative Inorder Traversal:
4 2 5 1 3 
```

**Visualization:**

Both methods visit nodes in the order: Left Subtree → Root → Right Subtree.

```
Inorder Traversal:
4 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 3
```

---

### Preorder Traversal

**Definition**: Visit the root node, traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree.

#### Recursive Preorder Traversal

```python
# File: tree_traversals.py:path/to/tree_traversals.py

def preorder_recursive(root):
    """
    Perform preorder traversal of a binary tree using recursion.
    Preorder Traversal Order: Root -> Left -> Right
    """
    if root:
        print(root.val, end=' ')        # Visit root
        preorder_recursive(root.left)    # Traverse left subtree
        preorder_recursive(root.right)   # Traverse right subtree

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nRecursive Preorder Traversal:")
    preorder_recursive(root)  # Output: 1 2 4 5 3
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive Preorder Traversal:
1 2 4 5 3 
```

#### Iterative Preorder Traversal

```python
# File: tree_traversals.py:path/to/tree_traversals.py

def preorder_iterative(root):
    """
    Perform preorder traversal of a binary tree using iteration.
    """
    if not root:
        return

    stack = [root]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()               # Pop node from stack
        print(node.val, end=' ')         # Visit node

        # Push right child first so that left child is processed first
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nIterative Preorder Traversal:")
    preorder_iterative(root)  # Output: 1 2 4 5 3
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative Preorder Traversal:
1 2 4 5 3 
```

**Visualization:**

Both methods visit nodes in the order: Root → Left Subtree → Right Subtree.

```
Preorder Traversal:
1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3
```

---

### Postorder Traversal

**Definition**: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, then visit the root node.

#### Recursive Postorder Traversal

```python
# File: tree_traversals.py:path/to/tree_traversals.py

def postorder_recursive(root):
    """
    Perform postorder traversal of a binary tree using recursion.
    Postorder Traversal Order: Left -> Right -> Root
    """
    if root:
        postorder_recursive(root.left)    # Traverse left subtree
        postorder_recursive(root.right)   # Traverse right subtree
        print(root.val, end=' ')          # Visit root

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nRecursive Postorder Traversal:")
    postorder_recursive(root)  # Output: 4 5 2 3 1
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive Postorder Traversal:
4 5 2 3 1 
```

#### Iterative Postorder Traversal

```python
# File: tree_traversals.py:path/to/tree_traversals.py

def postorder_iterative(root):
    """
    Perform postorder traversal of a binary tree using iteration.
    """
    if not root:
        return

    stack = [(root, False)]
    while stack:
        node, visited = stack.pop()
        if node:
            if visited:
                print(node.val, end=' ')  # Visit node
            else:
                # Postorder: Left, Right, Root
                stack.append((node, True))          # Mark node as visited
                stack.append((node.right, False))   # Push right child
                stack.append((node.left, False))    # Push left child

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nIterative Postorder Traversal:")
    postorder_iterative(root)  # Output: 4 5 2 3 1
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative Postorder Traversal:
4 5 2 3 1 
```

**Visualization:**

Both methods visit nodes in the order: Left Subtree → Right Subtree → Root.

```
Postorder Traversal:
4 → 5 → 2 → 3 → 1
```


####  Approach 2 :
 postorder traversal can be implemented iteratively without using the "visited" flag, though it's slightly more complex. Here's an alternative approach using two stacks:

```python:tree/tree-traversal-recursive-iterative.py
    def postorder_iterative(self, node: Optional["Node"]):
        print()
        if not node:
            return
            
        # Using two stacks - stack1 for processing nodes, stack2 for storing result
        stack1 = [node]
        stack2 = []
        
        # First, process nodes in (ROOT->RIGHT->LEFT) order into stack2
        while stack1:
            current = stack1.pop()
            stack2.append(current)
            
            # Push left first so it gets processed after right
            if current.left:
                stack1.append(current.left)
            if current.right:
                stack1.append(current.right)
        
        # Print from stack2 to get (LEFT->RIGHT->ROOT) order
        while stack2:
            node = stack2.pop()
            print(f"{node.value}", end=" ")
```

This approach works by:

1. Using two stacks instead of a visited flag
2. First stack (stack1) is used to process nodes in ROOT->RIGHT->LEFT order
3. Second stack (stack2) collects nodes in reverse order
4. When we print from stack2, we get LEFT->RIGHT->ROOT order (postorder)

The logic behind this approach:
- When we push ROOT, then RIGHT, then LEFT into stack1, popping from stack1 gives us ROOT->RIGHT->LEFT
- Pushing these popped items into stack2 maintains that order
- Finally, popping from stack2 reverses the order to LEFT->RIGHT->ROOT, which is what we want for postorder

This method is more space-intensive (using two stacks instead of one), but it avoids the need for the visited flag. Both approaches are valid, and the choice between them might depend on your specific needs:
- Single stack with visited flag: Uses less space but needs extra boolean flag
- Two stacks: Uses more space but conceptually simpler

The output will be identical to the previous implementation.

## Graph Traversals: Recursive and Iterative Methods

Graph traversals involve visiting all the nodes in a graph systematically. The two primary methods are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Both can be implemented recursively and iteratively.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Definition**: Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

#### Recursive DFS

```python
# File: graph_traversals.py:path/to/graph_traversals.py

def dfs_recursive(graph, start, visited=None):
    """
    Perform DFS traversal of a graph using recursion.
    :param graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list of the graph
    :param start: Starting node
    :param visited: Set to keep track of visited nodes
    """
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    print(start, end=' ')  # Visit node
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = {
        'A': ['B', 'C'],
        'B': ['D', 'E'],
        'C': ['F'],
        'D': [],
        'E': ['F'],
        'F': []
    }
    print("Recursive DFS Traversal:")
    dfs_recursive(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B D E F C
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive DFS Traversal:
A B D E F C 
```

#### Iterative DFS

```python
# File: graph_traversals.py:path/to/graph_traversals.py

def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    """
    Perform DFS traversal of a graph using iteration.
    :param graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list of the graph
    :param start: Starting node
    """
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node, end=' ')  # Visit node
            visited.add(node)
            # Add neighbors to stack in reverse order for correct traversal order
            stack.extend(reversed(graph[node]))  

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nIterative DFS Traversal:")
    dfs_iterative(graph, 'A')  # Output: A C F B E D
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative DFS Traversal:
A C F B E D 
```

**Note**: The order differs due to the stack's LIFO nature. To match recursive DFS order, manipulate the order in which neighbors are added to the stack.

**Visualization:**

```
Recursive DFS Traversal: A → B → D → E → F → C
Iterative DFS Traversal: A → C → F → B → E → D
```

---

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Definition**: Explore the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

#### Iterative BFS

```python
# File: graph_traversals.py:path/to/graph_traversals.py

from collections import deque

def bfs_iterative(graph, start):
    """
    Perform BFS traversal of a graph using iteration.
    :param graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list of the graph
    :param start: Starting node
    """
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            print(node, end=' ')  # Visit node
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node])

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nIterative BFS Traversal:")
    bfs_iterative(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B C D E F
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative BFS Traversal:
A B C D E F 
```

#### Recursive BFS

Implementing BFS recursively is less straightforward due to its inherently iterative nature. However, it can be achieved by processing nodes level by level.

```python
# File: graph_traversals.py:path/to/graph_traversals.py

def bfs_recursive_helper(graph, queue, visited, result):
    if not queue:
        return result
    current = queue.pop(0)
    if current not in visited:
        visited.add(current)
        result.append(current)
        queue.extend(graph[current])
    return bfs_recursive_helper(graph, queue, visited, result)

def bfs_recursive(graph, start):
    """
    Perform BFS traversal of a graph using recursion.
    :param graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list of the graph
    :param start: Starting node
    """
    visited = set()
    result = []
    queue = [start]
    bfs_recursive_helper(graph, queue, visited, result)
    return result

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Recursive BFS Traversal:")
    traversal_result = bfs_recursive(graph, 'A')  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
    print(' '.join(traversal_result))
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive BFS Traversal:
A B C D E F
```

**Visualization:**

```
BFS Traversal:
A → B → C → D → E → F
```

**Explanation:**

- **Iterative BFS** uses a queue to manage the order of node exploration.
- **Recursive BFS** manages the queue implicitly through recursive calls, processing one node per recursion level.

## Transforming Iterative Patterns into Recursive Solutions

Recursion can emulate loops by breaking down iterative processes into self-referential function calls. Let's explore transforming common iterative patterns, such as star patterns and loop-based algorithms, into recursive solutions.

### Star Patterns

**Problem**: Generate a right-angled star pattern of size `n`.

**Iterative Approach:**

```python
# File: star_patterns.py:path/to/star_patterns.py

def right_angled_star_iterative(n):
    """
    Generate a right-angled star pattern using iteration.
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('*' * i)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    size = 5
    print("Iterative Right-Angled Star Pattern:")
    right_angled_star_iterative(size)
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative Right-Angled Star Pattern:
*
**
***
****
*****
```

#### Recursive Approach

```python
# File: star_patterns.py:path/to/star_patterns.py

def right_angled_star_recursive(n, current=1):
    """
    Generate a right-angled star pattern using recursion.
    """
    if current > n:
        return
    print('*' * current)
    right_angled_star_recursive(n, current + 1)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nRecursive Right-Angled Star Pattern:")
    right_angled_star_recursive(size)
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive Right-Angled Star Pattern:
*
**
***
****
*****
```

**Explanation:**

- The recursive function `right_angled_star_recursive` prints `*` multiplied by the current line number and recursively calls itself with the next line number until the base case (`current > n`) is met.

---

### Other Loop-Based Methods

**Problem**: Calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `n`.

**Iterative Approach:**

```python
# File: loop_methods.py:path/to/loop_methods.py

def sum_iterative(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using iteration.
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    return total

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    number = 5
    print("Iterative Sum:", sum_iterative(number))  # Output: 15
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative Sum: 15
```

#### Recursive Approach

```python
# File: loop_methods.py:path/to/loop_methods.py

def sum_recursive(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using recursion.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    return n + sum_recursive(n - 1)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nRecursive Sum:", sum_recursive(number))  # Output: 15
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive Sum: 15
```

**Explanation:**

- The recursive function `sum_recursive` adds the current number `n` to the sum of numbers from `1` to `n - 1` until `n` reaches the base case (`n <= 0`).

---

### Factorial Calculation

**Problem**: Compute the factorial of a number `n`.

**Iterative Approach:**

```python
# File: loop_methods.py:path/to/loop_methods.py

def factorial_iterative(n):
    """
    Calculate factorial of n using iteration.
    """
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Iterative Factorial:", factorial_iterative(number))  # Output: 120 for n=5
```

**Output:**
```
Iterative Factorial: 120
```

#### Recursive Approach

```python
# File: loop_methods.py:path/to/loop_methods.py

def factorial_recursive(n):
    """
    Calculate factorial of n using recursion.
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)

# Example Usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\nRecursive Factorial:", factorial_recursive(number))  # Output: 120 for n=5
```

**Output:**
```
Recursive Factorial: 120
```

**Explanation:**

- The iterative function uses a loop to multiply all numbers from `2` to `n`.
- The recursive function multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n - 1` until it reaches the base case (`n == 0 or n == 1`).

## Best Practices for Switching Between Recursion and Iteration

1. **Understand the Problem Structure**:
   - **Recursive-Friendly Problems**: Tree traversals, graph traversals, divide and conquer algorithms.
   - **Iterative-Friendly Problems**: Simple loops, linear data processing, scenarios where maintaining state manually is straightforward.

2. **Consider Performance and Resource Constraints**:
   - **Recursion** can lead to higher memory usage due to the call stack.
   - **Iteration** is generally more memory-efficient and can be faster due to lower overhead.

3. **Use Appropriate Data Structures**:
   - **Recursive** implementations often leverage the call stack implicitly.
   - **Iterative** implementations may require explicit stacks or queues to manage traversal state.

4. **Handle Base Cases and Termination Conditions Carefully**:
   - Ensure every recursive function has a clear base case to prevent infinite recursion.
   - In iterative solutions, ensure loops have proper termination conditions.

5. **Optimize Recursive Solutions**:
   - Utilize **Memoization** to cache results and avoid redundant computations.
   - Convert tail-recursive functions to iterative counterparts when possible, especially in languages that optimize tail calls.

6. **Maintain Readability and Maintainability**:
   - Choose the approach that offers clearer and more maintainable code.
   - Sometimes, a recursive solution is more intuitive and aligns better with the problem's natural structure.

## NOTE: When to use STACK or  QUEUE ? 
Using a queue instead of a stack for iterative tree traversals can be more intuitive in some cases, but it depends on the specific traversal pattern we want to achieve. Let me explain the differences and show implementations using both approaches.

### Using Queue vs Stack for Tree Traversals

Let's compare both approaches for inorder traversal:

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Example tree:
#       1
#      / \
#     2   3
#    / \
#   4   5
```

### 1. Level Order Traversal (BFS)
This is where a queue shines naturally:

```python
def level_order_with_queue(root):
    """
    Using queue for level-order traversal (BFS)
    """
    if not root:
        return
    
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()  # O(1) operation
        print(node.val, end=' ')
        
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)

# Usage:
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

print("Level Order using Queue:")
level_order_with_queue(root)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

### 2. Inorder Traversal
Here's why we typically use a stack:

```python
def inorder_with_stack(root):
    """
    Using stack for inorder traversal (Left -> Root -> Right)
    """
    if not root:
        return
    
    stack = []
    current = root
    
    while stack or current:
        # Reach the leftmost node
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
            
        current = stack.pop()
        print(current.val, end=' ')
        current = current.right

print("\nInorder using Stack:")
inorder_with_stack(root)  # Output: 4 2 5 1 3
```

Attempting with Queue (More Complex):
```python
def inorder_with_queue(root):
    """
    Using queue for inorder traversal - more complicated and less intuitive
    """
    if not root:
        return
    
    queue = deque()
    current = root
    last_processed = None
    
    # Initial population of left nodes
    while current:
        queue.append(current)
        current = current.left
    
    while queue:
        node = queue[0]  # Peek at the front
        
        # If right subtree exists and hasn't been processed
        if node.right and last_processed != node.right:
            current = node.right
            while current:
                queue.appendleft(current)
                current = current.left
        else:
            node = queue.popleft()
            print(node.val, end=' ')
            last_processed = node

print("\nInorder using Queue (more complex):")
inorder_with_queue(root)  # Output: 4 2 5 1 3
```

### Why Stack is Preferred for DFS-based Traversals:

1. **Natural LIFO Behavior**:
   - Stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature naturally matches the backtracking behavior needed in DFS-based traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).
   - When we push nodes onto a stack, we can easily backtrack by popping them in reverse order.

2. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Stack allows us to maintain only the necessary path from root to current node.
   - Queue would require storing more nodes at once, potentially using more memory.

3. **Simplicity of Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Stack implementation is simpler:
   stack = []
   stack.append(item)    # Push
   item = stack.pop()    # Pop
   
   # Queue requires more complex state management:
   queue = deque()
   queue.appendleft(item)  # Push to front
   queue.append(item)      # Push to back
   item = queue.popleft()  # Pop from front
   ```

4. **Control Flow**:
   ```python
   # Stack provides natural control flow for DFS
   def dfs_with_stack(root):
       if not root:
           return
       
       stack = [root]
       while stack:
           node = stack.pop()
           print(node.val, end=' ')
           
           # Right child is pushed first so left is processed first
           if node.right:
               stack.append(node.right)
           if node.left:
               stack.append(node.left)
   ```

### When to Use Queue:

1. **Level-order Traversal (BFS)**:
   ```python
   def bfs_with_queue(root):
       if not root:
           return
       
       queue = deque([root])
       while queue:
           level_size = len(queue)
           for _ in range(level_size):
               node = queue.popleft()
               print(node.val, end=' ')
               
               if node.left:
                   queue.append(node.left)
               if node.right:
                   queue.append(node.right)
           print()  # New line for each level
   ```

2. **When Order Preservation is Important**:
   ```python
   def process_nodes_in_order(root):
       queue = deque([root])
       while queue:
           node = queue.popleft()
           # Process node in the exact order they were added
           process_node(node)
           
           # Add children in specific order
           if node.left:
               queue.append(node.left)
           if node.right:
               queue.append(node.right)
   ```

### Performance Comparison:

```python
import time

def measure_performance(func, root):
    start = time.time()
    func(root)
    end = time.time()
    return end - start

# Create a larger tree for testing
def create_large_tree(depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return None
    root = TreeNode(depth)
    root.left = create_large_tree(depth - 1)
    root.right = create_large_tree(depth - 1)
    return root

# Test with a larger tree
large_root = create_large_tree(10)

print("\nPerformance Comparison:")
print(f"Stack-based traversal: {measure_performance(inorder_with_stack, large_root):.6f} seconds")
print(f"Queue-based traversal: {measure_performance(inorder_with_queue, large_root):.6f} seconds")
```

The stack-based implementation is generally faster and more memory-efficient for DFS-based traversals because:
1. It matches the natural recursion structure
2. Requires fewer operations per node
3. Maintains a smaller working set of nodes

However, for BFS and level-order traversals, a queue is the natural and more efficient choice because it maintains the correct order of node processing at each level.

==Let's further break down why the iterative approaches for inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals are different, using clear examples and visualizations.==

Consider this binary tree for all examples:
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
```

# Comparing Iterative Tree Traversals, what are the differences ?

## 1. Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)

This is the simplest iterative implementation because we process the root first:

```python
def preorder_iterative(root):
    """
    Iterative preorder traversal
    Visit order: Root → Left → Right
    """
    if not root:
        return
    
    stack = [root]
    result = []
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.val)  # Process root first
        
        # Push right first (so left is processed first when popped)
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
    
    return result

# Visualization of stack operations:
"""
Initial stack: [1]
Step 1: Pop 1, print 1, push 3, push 2
Stack: [3, 2]

Step 2: Pop 2, print 2, push 5, push 4
Stack: [3, 5, 4]

Step 3: Pop 4, print 4
Stack: [3, 5]

Step 4: Pop 5, print 5
Stack: [3]

Step 5: Pop 3, print 3
Stack: []

Output: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3
"""
```

## 2. Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)

This is more complex because we need to reach the leftmost node before processing:

```python
def inorder_iterative(root):
    """
    Iterative inorder traversal
    Visit order: Left → Root → Right
    """
    stack = []
    current = root
    result = []
    
    while stack or current:
        # Reach the leftmost node
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
        
        current = stack.pop()
		
		# Process after all left nodes
		# print(current.val, end=" ") # or print it here instead        
        result.append(current.val)  
        
        current = current.right
    
    return result

# Visualization of stack operations:
"""
Step 1: Push nodes down left path
Stack: [1, 2, 4]

Step 2: Pop 4, print 4
Stack: [1, 2]

Step 3: Pop 2, print 2, move to 5
Stack: [1]
Push 5
Stack: [1, 5]

Step 4: Pop 5, print 5
Stack: [1]

Step 5: Pop 1, print 1, move to 3
Stack: []
Push 3
Stack: [3]

Step 6: Pop 3, print 3
Stack: []

Output: 4 → 2 → 5 → 1 → 3
"""
```

## 3. Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)

This is the most complex because we need to process the root last:

```python
def postorder_iterative(root):
    """
    Iterative postorder traversal
    Visit order: Left → Right → Root
    """
    if not root:
        return
    
    stack = [(root, False)]
    result = []
    
    while stack:
        node, visited = stack.pop()
        if node:
            if visited:
                result.append(node.val)  # Process node after children
            else:
                # Push in reverse order of processing
                stack.append((node, True))        # Root
                stack.append((node.right, False)) # Right
                stack.append((node.left, False))  # Left
    
    return result

# Visualization of stack operations:
"""
Initial: [(1, False)]

Step 1: Pop (1, False), push (1, True), (3, False), (2, False)
Stack: [(1, True), (3, False), (2, False)]

Step 2: Pop (2, False), push (2, True), (5, False), (4, False)
Stack: [(1, True), (3, False), (2, True), (5, False), (4, False)]

Step 3: Process 4

```

        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def print_traversal_steps(root, traversal_type):
    """
    Prints step-by-step visualization of different traversals
    """
    if traversal_type == "preorder":
        steps = preorder_with_steps(root)
    elif traversal_type == "inorder":
        steps = inorder_with_steps(root)
    else:  # postorder
        steps = postorder_with_steps(root)
    
    print(f"\n{traversal_type.capitalize()} Traversal Steps:")
    for i, (stack, operation, value) in enumerate(steps, 1):
        print(f"Step {i}:")
        print(f"Operation: {operation}")
        print(f"Stack: {stack}")
        if value is not None:
            print(f"Output: {value}")
        print()

def preorder_with_steps(root):
    steps = []
    if not root:
        return steps
    
    stack = [root]
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        steps.append((list(map(lambda x: x.val, stack)), "Pop and process", node.val))
        
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
            steps.append((list(map(lambda x: x.val, stack)), "Push right", None))
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
            steps.append((list(map(lambda x: x.val, stack)), "Push left", None))
    
    return steps

# Create tree and test
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

print_traversal_steps(root, "preorder")
print_traversal_steps(root, "inorder")
print_traversal_steps(root, "postorder")
```

### Key Differences Explained:

1. **Preorder (Root → Left → Right)**
   - Simplest because we process the root first
   - Stack only needs to store right and left children
   - Natural push/pop order matches traversal order

2. **Inorder (Left → Root → Right)**
   - Requires tracking current node separately
   - Must reach leftmost node before processing
   - Needs to maintain path to current node in stack

3. **Postorder (Left → Right → Root)**
   - Most complex because root must be processed last
   - Requires tracking visited state
   - Needs to revisit nodes to process after children

### Memory Usage Visualization:

```
Maximum Stack Size Comparison:
Preorder:  [3, 2]           (2 nodes)
Inorder:   [1, 2, 4]        (3 nodes)
Postorder: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]  (5 nodes)
```

### Time Complexity:
- All three traversals: O(n) where n is number of nodes
- Space Complexity: O(h) where h is height of tree
  - Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)
  - Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

The key to understanding these differences is recognizing that each traversal order requires different mechanisms to ensure nodes are processed in the correct order when using an iterative approach, while the recursive versions are much more similar because the recursion stack naturally handles the ordering.

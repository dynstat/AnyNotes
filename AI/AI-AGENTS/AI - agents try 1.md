Okay, let's break down how to build a production-level AI agent capable of tasks like email processing, secure web interaction, and form submission, drawing parallels to how agents in tools like Cursor or Windsurf might operate, but focusing on your broader requirements.

Building such an agent involves combining a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) with custom tools that allow it to interact with the outside world (email, web, files).

**Core Concepts & Common Architecture**

1.  **LLM as the "Brain":** The heart of the agent is an LLM (like Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude). It interprets user requests, reasons about the necessary steps, decides which tools to use, processes information returned by tools, and generates the final response or action plan. You're already using the `google-generativeai` SDK with Gemini, which is a great starting point.
2.  **Tool Use / Function Calling:** The LLM itself cannot directly browse the web, check email, or fill forms. You need to provide it with specific "tools" (functions) that it can request to be called. The LLM decides *which* tool to call and *what parameters* to pass (e.g., `read_email(subject="Invoice")`, `browse_website(url="example.com")`, `fill_form(url="jobsite.com/apply", fields={"name": "John Doe", "resume_path": "C:/path/to/resume.pdf"})`).
3.  **Agent Loop (Reasoning Cycle):** The agent operates in a loop:
    *   **Receive Input:** Get the user's request or the next task.
    *   **Plan/Reason:** The LLM analyzes the input, the conversation history, and the available tools. It decides the next step â€“ either call a tool or generate a final response. Patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act) are common, where the LLM explicitly outputs its thought process and the action (tool call) it wants to take.
    *   **Execute Tool:** If the LLM decides to use a tool, your backend code executes that specific function (e.g., actually logs into the email server, fetches the website content, or controls a browser).
    *   **Observe:** The result of the tool execution (email content, website text, success/failure message) is fed back to the LLM.
    *   **Repeat:** The LLM uses the observation to plan the next step, continuing the loop until the task is complete.
4.  **State Management:** The agent needs to maintain context, including conversation history, previous tool outputs, and its current objective.
5.  **Safety & Security:** This is paramount, especially when interacting with sensitive data (email) or external systems (web). Tools must have safeguards, validate inputs, handle errors gracefully, and avoid executing arbitrary or malicious code suggested by the LLM or found on the web. Interactions should ideally be sandboxed.

**Step-by-Step Approach & Recommended Libraries**

Based on the Salesforce article's general structure ("How to Build an AI Agent" [Source: salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/build-ai-agent/)) and your requirements:

**Step 1: Define Goals & Capabilities Clearly**

*   Read emails (specific folders/labels).
*   Classify emails (Spam/Not Spam - requires fine-tuning or specific prompting).
*   Browse websites (fetch content, follow specific links).
*   Extract information from web pages.
*   Upload files (PDF, DOCX) to web forms.
*   Fill and submit web forms.
*   *Crucially:* Define the boundaries. What *shouldn't* it do? (e.g., click ads, download arbitrary files, interact with unknown sites).

**Step 2: Choose the Core LLM**

*   You're using Gemini (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`) via the `google-generativeai` SDK. This is a powerful choice capable of complex reasoning and function calling. Stick with this unless you hit specific limitations.

**Step 3: Select an Agent Framework (Optional but Recommended)**

While you can build the agent logic directly using the `google-generativeai` SDK (like your `file_agent_client.py` example), frameworks abstract much of the complexity of the agent loop, tool definition, state management, and prompt engineering.

*   **LangChain:** Currently the most popular and feature-rich framework. It provides abstractions for LLMs, prompt templates, output parsers, agents (with different reasoning strategies like ReAct, Plan-and-Execute), tools, and vector stores. It has a steeper learning curve but is very flexible.
*   **LlamaIndex:** Primarily focused on data ingestion and retrieval (RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation), but also includes agent capabilities. Excellent if your agent needs to work heavily with your own documents (like indexing documentation before browsing).
*   **Haystack (by deepset):** Another strong framework with good components for building search and agentic systems.
*   **Custom Build:** Using just the LLM SDK (like `google-generativeai`). Gives you maximum control but requires implementing the agent loop, tool management, and prompting strategies yourself.

**Recommendation:** Start with **LangChain** or build upon your existing **`google-generativeai`** foundation by explicitly implementing the tool-calling and agent loop logic.

**Step 4: Develop Tools (Functions)**

This is where you implement the agent's capabilities. These will be Python functions that your agent framework or custom loop can call.

*   **Email Reading/Classification:**
    *   Libraries: `imaplib` (for IMAP access - reading), `smtplib` (for SMTP - sending, if needed), `email` (for parsing emails).
    *   Authentication: **Use OAuth 2.0 for Gmail/Outlook.** Avoid storing passwords directly. Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager for credentials/tokens.
    *   Functionality: `read_emails(folder="inbox", criteria="UNSEEN", count=5)`, `get_email_body(message_id)`, `classify_email(message_id, content)` (classification might involve calling the LLM again with specific instructions).
    *   Security: Only connect to trusted servers. Validate folder names. Be careful with parsing HTML emails for malicious content.

*   **Web Browsing & Scraping:**
    *   Libraries:
        *   `requests`: For simple, direct GET/POST requests to fetch static HTML.
        *   `beautifulsoup4` (BS4): For parsing HTML content fetched via `requests`.
        *   `selenium` or `playwright`: **Essential for complex tasks.** These automate a real web browser (Chrome, Firefox). Needed for:
            *   Handling JavaScript-heavy websites.
            *   Logging into sites.
            *   Clicking buttons/links.
            *   Filling forms.
            *   Uploading files.
    *   Functionality: `fetch_webpage_content(url)`, `find_links_on_page(url, keyword)`, `extract_data_from_page(url, css_selector)`, `fill_and_submit_form(url, form_selector, field_data, submit_selector)`, `upload_file_to_form(url, form_selector, file_input_selector, local_file_path)`.
    *   Security & Ethics:
        *   **Respect `robots.txt`.**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Don't overload websites.
        *   **Error Handling:** Websites change; selectors break. Build robust error handling.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running browser automation in isolated environments (like Docker) if possible.
        *   **Privacy ("Secretly"):** True secrecy is hard. Browser automation leaves fingerprints. Use reputable proxies or VPNs if anonymity is critical, but understand limitations. Avoid illicit scraping. Transparency is often better.
        *   **Safety:** Validate URLs. Prevent the agent from navigating to arbitrary/malicious links suggested by the LLM without strict checks. Maybe maintain an allowlist or blocklist of domains.

*   **File Handling (for Uploads):**
    *   Libraries: Standard Python `open()`, `os`. For reading content if needed: `pypdf2` or `pdfminer.six` (for PDF), `python-docx` (for DOCX).
    *   Functionality: Primarily used within the `selenium`/`playwright` tool for uploading. The tool needs the *local path* to the file (e.g., `C:/Users/You/Documents/resume.pdf`).
    *   Security: Validate file paths. Ensure the agent can only access permitted directories.

**Step 5: Implement the Agent Loop & Prompting**

*   **System Prompt:** Define the agent's persona, overall goal, available tools, and constraints (like safety rules). Your current prompt is a good start but needs expansion to include tool descriptions and rules.
*   **Tool Descriptions:** Provide clear descriptions of each tool and its parameters for the LLM, so it knows when and how to use them. The LLM uses these descriptions to decide which tool fits the current need.
*   **Loop Logic:**
    1.  Send the conversation history + user query + system prompt + tool descriptions to the LLM.
    2.  Check the LLM response:
        *   If it's a request to call a tool: Parse the tool name and arguments. Execute your corresponding Python function securely. Get the result.
        *   If it's a final answer: Return it to the user.
    3.  If a tool was called, add the tool call request and the tool's result (observation) back into the conversation history.
    4.  Repeat until the task is done or a final answer is generated.

**Step 6: Testing and Validation**

*   **Unit Test Tools:** Test each tool function independently with mock data and edge cases.
*   **Integration Test:** Test the agent's ability to correctly choose and use tools for multi-step tasks.
*   **Safety Testing:** Try to trick the agent into performing unsafe actions (e.g., "Read `/etc/passwd`", "Browse `malicious.com`", "Submit form with SQL injection"). Ensure safeguards work.
*   **User Testing:** (As mentioned in the Salesforce article) Get feedback from real users in controlled scenarios.

**Step 7: Deployment and Monitoring**

*   **Deployment:** Deploy as a web service (Flask, FastAPI), a background worker, or integrate into an existing application. Consider serverless functions for scalability if applicable.
*   **Monitoring:** Log all agent actions, tool calls, LLM interactions, and errors. Monitor performance (latency, success rate), costs (LLM API usage), and identify areas for improvement.

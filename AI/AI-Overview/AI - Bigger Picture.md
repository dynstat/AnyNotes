### 🧠 **Quick Note (Concise):**

> **LLMs (Large Language Models) _are_ a part of Deep Learning.**  
They are **deep neural networks** — specifically **Transformer-based models** trained on huge corpora of text.

The tree just visually separates different categories, but **LLMs are built using Deep Learning** techniques — particularly from the **Transformer** family (which is a subclass of deep learning architectures).

# Machine Learning Taxonomy Notes

## 1. Supervised Learning

  model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # X: square footage, y: house prices
  predictions = model.predict(X_test)
  ```
- **Real-life analogy:** Like forecasting how much your utility bill will increase based on past relationships between usage and cost

**Logistic Regression:**
- **What it is:** Predicts probability of binary outcomes using sigmoid function
- **Example:** Email spam detection (spam/not spam)
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  model = LogisticRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # X: email features, y: spam labels (0/1)
  probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)
  ```

### Deep Learning Algorithms

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
- **What it is:** Networks designed for grid-structured data using filters to detect patterns

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
      tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
  ])
  ```

      tf.keras.layers.Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  ```
- **Real-life analogy:** Like compressing a file to send it, then decompressing it—with the goal of improving quality

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
- **What it is:** Two competing networks—generator creates fake data, discriminator detects fakes

## 1. SQL

**Key Concepts:**

- **Normalization:** Reduces redundancy and improves data integrity.
- **Joins:** Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc., to combine data from related tables.
- **Indexing:** Improves performance by allowing the database to find rows faster.
- **Transactions & ACID:** Ensures data reliability (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Always use parameterized queries.

**Example Code:**  
```sql
-- File: sql/employee_department.sql
-- Create two related tables (employees and departments).
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

-- Select data using a join.
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**Python Example Using psycopg2 (Parameterized Query):**  
```python:sql/parameterized_query.py
import psycopg2

try:
    # Establish connection
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port="5432",
        database="your_db"
    )
    
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # Parameterized query to prevent SQL injection.
    select_query = "SELECT name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = %s;"
    cursor.execute(select_query, (1,))
    record = cursor.fetchone()
    print("Employee Name:", record)
    
except Exception as error:
    print("Error occurred:", error)
    
finally:
    if connection:
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
```

## 2. Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

**Key Concepts:**

- **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Discovering hidden structure without labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** An agent chooses actions based on rewards to maximize cumulative reward.  
  - In RL, the environment is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).  
  - Algorithms include Q-Learning and Policy Gradients.

**Reinforcement Learning Example using Q-Learning:**  
```python:examples/q_learning.py
"""
A simple Q-Learning simulation in a discrete environment.
States: Integers from 0 to 5.
Actions: 0 (move left) and 1 (move right).
Reward: +10 at state 5, -1 otherwise.
"""

import numpy as np

n_states = 6
actions = [0, 1]
q_table = np.zeros((n_states, len(actions)))
alpha = 0.1     # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9     # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.2   # Exploration rate

def choose_action(state):
    """Epsilon-greedy action selection."""
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return np.random.choice(actions)
    return np.argmax(q_table[state])  # Best action based on current Q-values.

def get_next_state(state, action):
    """Simulate moving left or right."""
    if action == 0:
        return max(0, state - 1)  # Do not go below state 0.
    return min(n_states - 1, state + 1)  # Do not exceed maximum state.

def get_reward(state):
    """Reward is +10 when state reaches the final state, else -1."""
    return 10 if state == n_states - 1 else -1

# Training loop.
for episode in range(1000):
    state = np.random.randint(0, n_states - 1)
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = choose_action(state)
        next_state = get_next_state(state, action)
        reward = get_reward(next_state)
        # Update rule for Q-learning.
        q_table[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(q_table[next_state]) - q_table[state, action])
        state = next_state
        if state == n_states - 1:
            done = True

print("Trained Q-Table:")
print(q_table)
```

## 3. Python Libraries: Numpy & Pandas

### Numpy

**Concepts:**
- Efficient computation with multi-dimensional arrays.
- Supports vectorized operations that eliminate explicit loops.

**Example Code:**  
```python:examples/numpy_example.py
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array.
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Original array:", arr)

# Perform a vectorized operation (element-wise squaring).
arr_squared = arr ** 2
print("Squared array:", arr_squared)
```

### Pandas

**Concepts:**
- DataFrames for data manipulation and analysis.
- Handling CSVs, missing data, and aggregation operations.

**Example Code:**  
```python:examples/pandas_example.py
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary.
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'Department': ['HR', 'Engineering', 'Marketing']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Example: Reading CSV data.
# df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

## 4. Cross-Platform Desktop App Development

**Key Frameworks:**
- **Electron:** Use web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for desktop apps.
- **Qt/PyQt/wxWidgets:** Traditional C++ or Python-based GUI frameworks.
- **Flutter:** Increasingly used for desktop alongside mobile development.

**Electron Example:**  
```javascript:desktop-app/main.js
// Entry point for an Electron application.
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createWindow() {
    // Create a new window with specified dimensions.
    let win = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        webPreferences: {
            nodeIntegration: true  // Allow Node.js integration.
        }
    });
    // Load the HTML file for the application.
    win.loadFile('index.html');
}

// Called when Electron is ready.
app.whenReady().then(createWindow);

// Quit the app when all windows are closed (except on macOS).
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
    if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
        app.quit();
    }
});

app.on('activate', () => {
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
        createWindow(); // Re-create window if necessary (macOS behavior).
    }
});
```

## 5. PostgreSQL

**Key Points:**
- **Advanced Features:** Window functions, JSON support, partitioning.
- **Administration:** Use commands like `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.

**Example Commands:**  
```bash
# Backup a PostgreSQL database.
pg_dump -U postgres -Fc mydatabase > mydatabase.dump

# Restore a PostgreSQL backup.
pg_restore -U postgres -d mydatabase_restored mydatabase.dump
```

---

## 6. Django/DRF & FastAPI

### Django with Django REST Framework (DRF)

**Concepts:**
- Django is a high-level web framework.
- DRF simplifies building RESTful APIs.

**Example Code:**  
```python:myproject/api/views.py
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status

class HelloWorld(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        # Simple GET request returning JSON response.
        return Response({"message": "Hello, world!"}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

```python:myproject/api/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import HelloWorld

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', HelloWorld.as_view(), name='hello-world'),
]
```

### FastAPI

**Concepts:**
- Fast building with asynchronous endpoints.
- Leverages Python type hints for validation.

**Example Code:**  
```python:myproject/fastapi_app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hello")
async def hello():
    """
    GET endpoint that returns a greeting message.
    """
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}

# To run this FastAPI app, use the command:
# uvicorn myproject.fastapi_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

---

## 7. Networking: TCP, UNIX Domain Sockets & Websockets

### TCP & UNIX Domain Sockets

**TCP Sockets:**
- Used for network communications over IP.
- Suitable for client-server communications where endpoints may be separate machines.

**Example TCP Client in Python:**  
```python:examples/tcp_client.py
import socket

# Create a TCP socket.
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_address = ('localhost', 5000)  # Replace with actual server address and port.

client_socket.connect(server_address)
client_socket.sendall(b'Hello, server!')  # Send data.

data = client_socket.recv(1024)  # Receive response.
print("Received:", data.decode())
client_socket.close()
```

**UNIX Domain Sockets:**
- Used for inter-process communication on the same host.
- Faster due to bypassing network stack overhead.

**Example UNIX Domain Socket Server in Python:**  
```python:examples/unix_socket_server.py
import socket
import os

socket_file = '/tmp/unix_socket'

# Remove the existing socket file if it exists.
if os.path.exists(socket_file):
    os.remove(socket_file)

server = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind(socket_file)
server.listen(1)
print("Waiting for a connection...")

connection, client_address = server.accept()
try:
    data = connection.recv(1024)
    print("Received:", data.decode())
finally:
    connection.close()
    os.remove(socket_file)
```

### Websockets

**Key Concepts:**
- Enable full-duplex, real-time communication over a single TCP connection.
- Ideal for chat apps, live notifications, etc.

**Example Websocket Server in Python using `websockets`:**  
```python:examples/ws_server.py
import asyncio
import websockets

async def echo(websocket, path):
    # Echoes all messages back to the client.
    async for message in websocket:
        await websocket.send(message)

start_server = websockets.serve(echo, "localhost", 6789)

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
```

---

## 8. Web Development & Secure VPS Deployment

### General Web Development

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend:** Utilize frameworks (Django, FastAPI) with secure coding practices (input sanitization, CSRF protection).

### Secure VPS Deployment

**Best Practices:**
- **Firewall Configuration:** Use Windows Firewall on Windows or `iptables`/`ufw` on Linux.
- **SSH Security:** Implement key-based authentication, disable root login, and change default SSH port.
- **Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing:**  
  - **Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx):** Acts as an intermediary to forward client requests to back-end services.
  - **Load Balancer:** Distributes requests across multiple servers.

**Nginx Reverse Proxy Example:**  
```nginx
# File: /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; # Back-end application running on port 8000.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

## 9. Containers and Orchestration: Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes

### Docker

**Key Concepts:**
- Package applications and dependencies into containers.
- Use a **Dockerfile** to define the build steps for your image.

**Example Dockerfile for a FastAPI App:**  
```dockerfile
# File: Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency list and install.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application source code.
COPY . .

# Expose port 8000.
EXPOSE 8000

# Define the default command.
CMD ["uvicorn", "myproject.fastapi_app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Docker Swarm

**Key Points:**
- Built-in container orchestration in Docker.
- Use commands to initialize swarm and deploy services.

**Example Commands:**  
```bash
# Initialize Docker Swarm.
docker swarm init

# Deploy a service with port publishing.
docker service create --name myservice --publish 8000:8000 myapp:latest
```

### Kubernetes

**Key Points:**
- Manages containerized applications at scale.
- Utilizes YAML files for defining configurations.

**Example Pod YAML:**  
```yaml
# File: k8s/pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fastapi-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: fastapi-container
      image: myapp:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```

---

## 10. CI/CD & Version Control (Git/GitHub/GitLab)

### CI/CD

**Concepts:**
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically build and test code changes.
- **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploy code to production.

**Example GitLab CI/CD Pipeline:**  
```yaml
# File: .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."
    - docker build -t myapp:latest .

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - pytest

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project..."
    - docker push myapp:latest
```

### Git/GitHub/GitLab

**Key Git Commands:**
- `git clone`: Clone a repository.
- `git branch`: Create and list branches.
- `git commit`: Record changes.
- `git push`: Update remote repository.
- `git merge`: Integrate branches.

**Example Commands:**  
```bash
git init                     # Initialize new repository.
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add README.md            # Stage file for commit.
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myproject.git
git push -u origin master    # Push commits to remote master branch.
```

---

## 11. AWS

**Key AWS Services:**
- **EC2:** Virtual machines.
- **S3:** Object storage.
- **VPC:** Isolated networking environment.
- **Lambda:** Serverless computing.
- **RDS:** Managed relational databases.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use CloudFormation or Terraform.

**CloudFormation Example Snippet:**  
```yaml
# File: aws/cloudformation_ec2.yaml
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890  # Replace with a valid Region-specific Image ID.
```

## 12. UMDF Windows Driver Development and ISO Standards

### UMDF2 (User Mode Driver Framework Version 2)

**Key Points:**
- **UMDF2:** Allows driver development in user mode to improve stability.
- **Virtual Smart Card Reader Driver:** Involves handling I/O requests, device enumeration, and asynchronous operations.
- **Development Tools:** Use Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and debugging tools like WinDbg.

**Pseudo-code Example:**  
```cpp
// File: Driver/MySmartCardReader.cpp
#include <wdf.h>
#include "MySmartCardReader.h"

// Entry point for a UMDF2 driver.
extern "C" HRESULT WINAPI WdfDriverEntry(_In_ const WDF_DRIVER_CONFIG* DriverConfig, _In_ PWDFDRIVER_INIT DriverInit) {
    // Initialize the driver and register device callbacks.
    // Typically calls to functions like WdfDriverCreate() are made here.
    return S_OK;
}
```

### ISO Standards: ISO-7816 & ISO-14443

- **ISO-7816:** Specifies communication for contact (wired) smart cards.
- **ISO-14443:** Defines contactless smart card (NFC) protocols.
- **Analogy:**  
  - *ISO-7816 is like a landline telephone conversation (physical connection), whereas ISO-14443 is analogous to a mobile phone call (wireless communication).*

---

## 13. Linux Reader Driver

**Key Concepts:**
- Involves kernel module programming.
- Communicates between user space and kernel space.
- **Tools:** `dmesg` for logs, `insmod`/`rmmod` for module management.

**Example Linux Character Device Driver:**  
```c
// File: drivers/char/simple_char_driver.c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <linux/uaccess.h>

#define DEVICE_NAME "simple_char"

static int major;
static char device_buffer[256];

static int device_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file) {
    // Called when the device is opened.
    return 0;
}

static ssize_t device_read(struct file *file, char __user *buffer, size_t length, loff_t *offset) {
    size_t bytes = simple_strnlen(device_buffer, sizeof(device_buffer));
    if (copy_to_user(buffer, device_buffer, bytes))
        return -EFAULT;
    return bytes;
}

static struct file_operations fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .open = device_open,
    .read = device_read,
};

static int __init simple_char_init(void) {
    // Register the character device to receive a dynamic major number.
    major = register_chrdev(0, DEVICE_NAME, &fops);
    if (major < 0) {
        printk(KERN_ALERT "Failed to register char device, major: %d\n", major);
        return major;
    }
    printk(KERN_INFO "Device registered with major number %d\n", major);
    return 0;
}

static void __exit simple_char_exit(void) {
    // Unregister the device.
    unregister_chrdev(major, DEVICE_NAME);
}

module_init(simple_char_init);
module_exit(simple_char_exit);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Your Name");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("A simple Linux character driver for a reader device");
```

Below is an extended, detailed guide to SQL. This guide covers everything from basic concepts and data modeling to advanced queries and security, with multiple code examples, practical use cases, and detailed comments.

---

# **SQL Detailed Revision Guide**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It is critical for building applications, data analysis, and ensuring data integrity. In this guide, we’ll dive deep into:

1. [**Introduction & Use Cases**](#introduction-use-cases)
2. [**Data Modeling & Normalization**](#data-modeling--normalization)
3. [**Core SQL Statements (DDL & DML)**](#core-sql-statements-ddl--dml)
4. [**Joins & Aggregations**](#joins--aggregations)
5. [**Indexes & Query Optimization**](#indexes--query-optimization)
6. [**Transactions & ACID Properties**](#transactions--acid-properties)
7. [**Security & SQL Injection Prevention**](#security--sql-injection-prevention)
8. [**Advanced Topics & Best Practices**](#advanced-topics--best-practices)

Each section includes practical examples, code samples, and analogies to help you grasp the concepts thoroughly.

---

## Introduction & Use Cases

SQL is used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data in relational databases. It is widely adopted due to its ability to handle complex queries, support transactional systems, and maintain data integrity.  

**Analogy:**  
Think of an SQL database as the ultimate filing system. Every table acts as a drawer filled with files. SQL commands are the instructions given to access specific files (data) or update their contents.

**Practical Use Cases:**
- **Enterprise Applications:** Banking systems, inventory management.
- **Data Analytics:** Aggregating sales data, user activity logs.
- **Web Applications:** Backends developed with frameworks like Django or FastAPI.
- **Reporting Systems:** Generating dashboards from large datasets.

---

## Data Modeling & Normalization

Before writing any SQL statements, designing the database schema is essential. A well-designed schema minimizes redundancy and ensures consistency.

### **Normalization Concepts**

**Normalization** refers to the process of organizing data in the database. The goals are to:
- Minimize duplication.
- Ensure data integrity.
- Simplify data maintenance.

**Normalization Forms:**

1. **First Normal Form (1NF):**  
   - Each table cell must contain a single, atomic value.
   - There should be no repeating groups or arrays.

2. **Second Normal Form (2NF):**  
   - Achieved when the table is in 1NF and every non-primary key attribute is fully dependent on the primary key (no partial dependency).

3. **Third Normal Form (3NF):**  
   - In 2NF and no transitive dependency exists among non-key columns.

### **Example: Unnormalized vs. Normalized Schema**

Imagine you have employee data with department information directly in the employee record:

**Unnormalized (Not Recommended):**

| EmployeeID | Name    | Department           |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| 1          | Alice   | Engineering, R&D     |
| 2          | Bob     | Sales, Marketing     |
| 3          | Charlie | Engineering, R&D     |

*Issues:*  
- Repeating department names.
- Increased storage and inconsistencies when the department name changes.

**Normalized Version:**

1. **Departments Table:**

```sql:sql/normalized_departments.sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier.
    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL  -- For example, 'Engineering'
);
```

2. **Employees Table:**

```sql:sql/normalized_employees.sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique for each employee.
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,      -- Employee name.
    department_id INT,               -- Reference to departments.
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

*Benefits:*  
- **Consistency:** Changing the department name in one place updates all references.  
- **Space-Efficient:** Avoids duplication of department names across many employee records.

---

## Core SQL Statements (DDL & DML)

SQL is divided into several language subsets. The two primary ones are Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

### **Data Definition Language (DDL)**

DDL statements define the structure of your database objects.

1. **CREATE TABLE:**  
   Used to create new tables.

   ```sql:sql/create_tables.sql
   -- Create departments table
   CREATE TABLE departments (
       department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
   );

   -- Create employees table referencing departments
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       department_id INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
   );
   ```

2. **ALTER TABLE:**  
   Modify an existing table, such as adding or removing columns.
   
   ```sql:sql/alter_table.sql
   -- Adding a new column for employee email.
   ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
   ```

3. **DROP TABLE:**  
   Remove a table from the database.
   
   ```sql:sql/drop_table.sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS departments;
   ```

### **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

DML statements are used for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

1. **INSERT:**  
   Add new records to a table.

   ```sql:sql/insert_data.sql
   -- Insert into departments
   INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES ('HR'), ('Engineering'), ('Marketing');

   -- Insert into employees
   INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, email) VALUES
   ('Alice', 2, 'alice@company.com'),
   ('Bob', 3, 'bob@company.com'),
   ('Charlie', 2, 'charlie@company.com');
   ```

2. **SELECT:**  
   Retrieve data from one or more tables.
   
   ```sql:sql/basic_select.sql
   -- Retrieve all employees
   SELECT * FROM employees;

   -- Retrieve specific columns with an alias
   SELECT name AS employee_name, email AS contact_email FROM employees;
   ```

3. **UPDATE:**  
   Modify existing data.
   
   ```sql:sql/update_data.sql
   -- Update Bob's email address.
   UPDATE employees
   SET email = 'robert@company.com'
   WHERE name = 'Bob';
   ```

4. **DELETE:**  
   Remove records from a table.
   
   ```sql:sql/delete_data.sql
   -- Delete employee record by employee_id.
   DELETE FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = 1;
   ```

**Best Practices in DML:**
- **Specify columns in INSERT:** Avoid using `INSERT INTO table VALUES (...)` because it is more error-prone if table structure changes.
- **Use WHERE clause carefully:** Always include a conditional clause like `WHERE` when updating or deleting records to avoid unwanted data loss.

---

## Joins & Aggregations

### **Joins**

Joins allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

#### **Types of Joins:**

1. **INNER JOIN:**  
   Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

   ```sql:sql/inner_join.sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
   ```

2. **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:**  
   Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If no match exists, results from the right are NULL.

   ```sql:sql/left_join.sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
   ```

3. **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:**  
   Opposite of LEFT JOIN. Returns all rows from the right table plus matched rows from the left.

   ```sql:sql/right_join.sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
   ```

4. **FULL OUTER JOIN:**  
   Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Many RDBMS do not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly and require workarounds.

   ```sql:sql/full_outer_join.sql
   SELECT e.name, d.department_name
   FROM employees e
   FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
   ```

**Use-Case Analogy:**  
Imagine you manage two lists: one of employees and another of departments. Joins allow you to merge these lists based on common department identifiers, much like combining a mailing list with demographic data.

### **Aggregations**

Aggregation functions summarize data. Common functions include:

- **COUNT:** Counts rows.
- **SUM:** Adds up numeric values.
- **AVG:** Computes the average.
- **MIN/MAX:** Finds minimum or maximum values.

#### **Examples:**

1. **Count Employees per Department:**

   ```sql:sql/count_employees.sql
   SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS total_employees
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department_id;
   ```

2. **Total and Average Salary (Assuming salary column exists):**

   ```sql:sql/salary_aggregations.sql
   SELECT department_id,
          SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
          AVG(salary) AS average_salary
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department_id;
   ```

3. **Using HAVING Clause:**  
   Filter groups based on aggregated values.

   ```sql:sql/having_clause.sql
   SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS total_employees
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department_id
   HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 2;
   ```

4. **Window Functions:**  
   Provide aggregated values across specified partitions while retaining row-level detail.

   ```sql:sql/window_function.sql
   SELECT 
       name, 
       department_id,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY name) AS rank_in_department
   FROM employees;
   ```

*Practical Use Case:*  
Window functions are ideal for ranking, running totals, and moving averages. For instance, in sales data analysis, you can compute the rank of each salesperson within their region without losing details about individual transactions.

## Indexes & Query Optimization

Indexes are special data structures that speed up data retrieval operations on a table. However, they come at a cost to write performance (inserts/updates) and require careful planning.

### **Types of Indexes:**

1. **Single-Column Indexes:**  
   Useful when filtering based on a single column frequently.

   ```sql:sql/single_column_index.sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees (name);
   ```

2. **Composite (Multi-Column) Indexes:**  
   Useful when your queries often filter by more than one column.

   ```sql:sql/composite_index.sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name_dept ON employees (name, department_id);
   ```

3. **Unique Indexes:**  
   Enforce uniqueness along with improving read performance.

   ```sql:sql/unique_index.sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON employees (email);
   ```

### **Query Optimization:**

- **Analyzing Queries:**  
  Use tools like `EXPLAIN` (or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL) to view query execution plans.

  ```sql:sql/explain_query.sql
  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'Alice';
  ```

- **Avoiding Over-Indexing:**  
  Too many indexes can slow down write operations.

- **Statistics & Maintenance:**  
  Regularly update statistics and consider routine maintenance (e.g., reindexing) to ensure your queries perform optimally.

*Analogous Idea:*  
Indexes are like the index in a book. They let you quickly jump to the section you need; however, if every little detail had its own index, the overhead in maintaining that index might slow down new content additions (inserts/updates).

## Transactions & ACID Properties

### **Transactions:**

A transaction is a group of operations executed as a single logical unit that must either complete in its entirety or have no effect at all.

### **ACID Principles:**

1. **Atomicity:**  
   The entire transaction is all-or-nothing.  
   *Example:* A bank transfer: Either money is correctly debited and credited, or neither happens.

2. **Consistency:**  
   A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another valid state.  
   *Use Case:* Constraints such as unique keys, foreign keys automatically enforce consistency.

3. **Isolation:**  
   Transactions operate in isolation from one another until complete.  
   *Example:* Two simultaneous transactions do not see each other's partial results.

4. **Durability:**  
   Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent.  
   *Example:* Even after a server crash, committed transactions are retained.

### **Example Transaction:**

```sql:sql/transaction_example.sql
BEGIN;  -- Start transaction

-- Insert a new department.
INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES ('Customer Support');

-- Insert an employee assigned to the new department.
-- Assuming the new department gets department_id = 4.
INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, email)
VALUES ('Derek', 4, 'derek@company.com');

-- If all operations execute correctly, then commit the transaction.
COMMIT;

-- If any error occurs, you should rollback:
-- ROLLBACK;
```

### **Handling Errors:**

In application code, you can use try/catch (or try/except) blocks around transaction code to perform a rollback if any error occurs. For example, in Python:

```python:sql/python_transaction_example.py
import psycopg2

try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        user="your_username", password="your_password",
        host="127.0.0.1", port="5432", database="your_db"
    )
    connection.autocommit = False  # Disable autocommit for transaction management.
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Begin transaction
    cursor.execute("BEGIN;")
    
    # Example: Insert operations
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES (%s);", ('Legal',))
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s);", 
                   ('Eva', 5, 'eva@company.com'))
    
    # Commit the transaction if successful.
    connection.commit()
    
except Exception as error:
    print("Transaction error occurred:", error)
    connection.rollback()  # Roll back all operations if any error occurs.
    
finally:
    if connection:
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
```

## Security & SQL Injection Prevention

### **Understanding SQL Injection:**

SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious SQL code through input parameters. This can compromise your database, leak sensitive data, or even damage data integrity.

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  
   Instead of concatenating strings, use placeholders with libraries like `psycopg2` (for Python).

2. **Input Validation:**  
   Validate, sanitize, and limit the input length whenever possible.

3. **Least Privilege Principle:**  
   Use a database user with restricted permissions for your application.

### **Example in Python using psycopg2:**

```python:sql/secure_query.py
import psycopg2

try:
    # Connect using secure credentials.
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port="5432",
        database="your_db"
    )
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Secure parameterized query prevents SQL injection.
    query = "SELECT name, email FROM employees WHERE employee_id = %s;"
    param = (1,)  # Tuple with single element.
    cursor.execute(query, param)
    
    record = cursor.fetchone()
    print("Employee Record:", record)
    
except Exception as error:
    print("An error occurred:", error)
    
finally:
    if connection:
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
```

*Practical Tip:*  
Even if your framework supports parameterized queries (like Django ORM or SQLAlchemy), always be mindful of raw SQL queries and avoid dynamic SQL concatenation.

## Advanced Topics & Best Practices

Beyond the basics, several advanced SQL topics can boost your application’s performance and manageability.

### **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):**

CTEs allow you to write reusable subqueries and improve the readability of complex queries.

```sql:sql/cte_example.sql
WITH RecentHires AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, hire_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT * FROM RecentHires;
```

### **Recursive Queries:**

Useful for hierarchical data like organizational charts.

```sql:sql/recursive_query.sql
WITH RECURSIVE OrgChart AS (
   -- Anchor member: start at the top-level roles.
   SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id
   FROM employees
   WHERE manager_id IS NULL 
   UNION ALL
   -- Recursive member: select all employees under managers.
   SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id
   FROM employees e
   INNER JOIN OrgChart o ON e.manager_id = o.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM OrgChart;
```

### **Triggers & Stored Procedures:**

- **Triggers:** Automatically execute SQL code in response to certain events on a table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
  
  ```sql:sql/trigger_example.sql
  -- Create a trigger to log deletions from the employees table.
  CREATE TABLE employee_deletions (
      deletion_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      employee_id INT,
      deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );

  -- Create function to handle trigger event.
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_employee_deletion() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
      INSERT INTO employee_deletions(employee_id)
      VALUES (OLD.employee_id);
      RETURN OLD;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  -- Bind trigger to employees table.
  CREATE TRIGGER employee_delete_trigger
  AFTER DELETE ON employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_employee_deletion();
  ```

- **Stored Procedures:** Encapsulate complex logic that can then be executed on demand.

  ```sql:sql/stored_procedure_example.sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE sp_update_employee_email(emp_id INT, new_email VARCHAR)
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  AS $$
  BEGIN
      UPDATE employees SET email = new_email
      WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
  END;
  $$;
  
  -- To call the stored procedure:
  CALL sp_update_employee_email(2, 'bob_updated@company.com');
  ```

### **Best Practices Summary:**

- **Schema Design:**  
  Spend ample time designing your database. Use normalization to eliminate redundancy but understand when denormalization may be appropriate for performance.

- **Query Writing:**  
  - Use explicit JOINs and avoid using `SELECT *` in production.
  - Leverage CTEs and subqueries for improved readability.
  - Always test performance using `EXPLAIN`.

- **Indexing:**  
  Balance between read performance and the overhead on write operations.

- **Transaction Management:**  
  Use transactions judiciously when you perform multiple operations that must be all successful or entirely rolled back.

- **Security:**  
  Emphasize using parameterized queries, strict permissions, and regularly updating software components to patch vulnerabilities.

- **Maintainability:**  
  Document schema changes via migrations and version control your SQL scripts.

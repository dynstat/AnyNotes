    - **Example**: Customer segmentation.
    - **Analogy**: Like grouping similar colors in an image.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensions of data for easier visualization.
    
    - **Analogy**: Like compressing an image to save space without losing critical details.

#### **Reinforcement Learning**

- **Definition**: Agents learn by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards.
- **Example**: AI in games like Chess.
- **Analogy**: Like training a dog with treats for good behavior.

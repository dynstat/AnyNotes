## Overview

Let's break down how to build your own Model Context Protocol (MCP) client using the Python SDK, potentially incorporating agent-like logic to interact with various MCP servers.

Based on the provided resources ([MCP Python SDK GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), [MCP Architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture), [Client Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client), [Building with LLMs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/building-mcp-with-llms), [Debugging Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging)):

**1. Understanding the MCP Client Role**

*   **Mediator:** An MCP client acts as an intermediary between a user (or an automated process) and an MCP server.
*   **Context Provider:** The client application often manages the core context (like files open in an editor, user state, etc.) and exposes relevant parts as *Resources* to the server when requested.
*   **User Interface (Optional):** It might provide the UI for users to invoke *Prompts* offered by the server.
*   **Model Interaction Handler:** Crucially, the client handles requests from the server that require LLM processing (like generating text or deciding which tool to call). This is where your "agent" logic comes in.

**2. Key Components in the `mcp` Python SDK for Clients**

*   **`StdioServerParameters` (or similar):** Defines *how* to connect to the MCP server. The most common example uses `stdio` (standard input/output), typically for running a server script locally.
    *   `command`: The executable to run (e.g., `python`).
    *   `args`: Arguments for the command (e.g., `['my_server_script.py']`).
    *   `env`: Optional environment variables for the server process.
*   **`stdio_client` (or similar connection function):** An asynchronous context manager that establishes the connection based on the parameters, providing `read` and `write` streams.
*   **`ClientSession`:** The main class for managing the communication session with the server once connected. It handles the MCP message exchange.
*   **`sampling_callback`:** An *optional* asynchronous function you provide to `ClientSession`. This is the core of your client-side agent/LLM integration. It gets called when the server sends a request requiring the *client's* model to generate a response (e.g., replying to a user query, deciding on the next step).

**3. Steps to Create Your MCP Client**

**Step 3.1: Define Server Connection Parameters**

Decide how you'll connect. For a local Python script server:

```python
# Define how to launch and connect to the MCP server
# This assumes you have a server script 'my_mcp_server.py'
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="python",           # The command to run the server
    args=["my_mcp_server.py"], # Arguments for the command
    # env={"API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY"} # Optional environment variables
)

# If connecting to a different type of server (e.g., over network),
# you would use different parameters/connection methods if available in the SDK
# or implement the connection logic yourself based on the MCP specification.
```

**Step 3.2: Implement the `sampling_callback` (Your Agent Logic)**

This function receives `CreateMessageRequestParams` from the server and must return `CreateMessageResult`. This is where you integrate your LLM call or other decision-making logic.

```python
import mcp.types as types
# Assume you have a function 'get_llm_response(messages)' that calls your LLM
# from your_llm_library import get_llm_response

async def my_agent_handler(
    request: types.CreateMessageRequestParams,
) -> types.CreateMessageResult:
    """
    Handles requests from the MCP server that require model generation.
    This is the core of the client-side "agent".
    """
    print(f"Received sampling request from server. Messages so far:")
    for msg in request.messages:
        print(f"- Role: {msg.role}, Content Type: {type(msg.content)}")
        # Add logic here to print or process different content types

    # --- Your Agent/LLM Logic Goes Here ---
    # 1. You might preprocess `request.messages` for your LLM.
    # 2. Call your LLM with the message history.
    # 3. Process the LLM's response.

    # Example: Simple static response
    # llm_response_text = "This is the client agent's response."

    # Example: Calling an actual LLM (replace with your implementation)
    try:
         # llm_response = await get_llm_response(request.messages)
         # llm_response_text = llm_response.text # Adjust based on your LLM lib
         llm_response_text = f"Agent received {len(request.messages)} messages. Replying now." # Placeholder
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error calling LLM: {e}")
         llm_response_text = "Sorry, I encountered an error."
         stop_reason = "error"
    else:
         stop_reason = "endTurn" # Or other reasons like 'toolUse' if your LLM decides to call a tool

    # --- Construct the response for the MCP Server ---
    return types.CreateMessageResult(
        role="assistant", # Typically 'assistant' for model responses
        content=types.TextContent(
            type="text",
            text=llm_response_text,
        ),
        # Optional fields:
        model="my-client-agent-v1", # Identify your agent/model
        stopReason=stop_reason, # Why generation stopped ('endTurn', 'toolUse', 'maxTokens', 'stopSequence', 'error')
        # stopSequence=None,
        # metadata=None,
    )
```
*(Self-correction: The `sampling_callback` is triggered when the *server* needs input/generation from the *client's side model/agent*, not necessarily only after tool calls. It's the general mechanism for the client to participate in the conversation flow using its own intelligence.)*

**Step 3.3: Establish Connection and Run the Session**

Use `stdio_client` (or another method) and `ClientSession`.

```python
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client # Use the appropriate client connector

async def run_client():
    print(f"Attempting to connect to server using: {server_params.command} {' '.join(server_params.args)}")
    try:
        # Establish the connection using the defined parameters
        async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read_stream, write_stream):
            print("Connection established. Creating ClientSession...")
            # Create the client session, passing the streams and your agent logic
            async with ClientSession(
                read_stream,
                write_stream,
                sampling_callback=my_agent_handler # Wire in your agent
            ) as session:
                print("ClientSession created. Initializing...")
                # Initialize the MCP connection (handshake)
                init_response = await session.initialize()
                print("Initialization complete.")
                print(f"Server Name: {init_response.server_info.name}")
                print(f"Server Version: {init_response.server_info.version}")
                print("Supported capabilities:", init_response.capabilities)

                # --- Interact with the Server ---
                # Now you can use session methods to interact

                # Example: List available prompts
                try:
                    prompts = await session.list_prompts()
                    print("\nAvailable Prompts:")
                    if prompts:
                        for p in prompts:
                            print(f"- {p.name}: {p.description}")
                    else:
                        print("  (No prompts available)")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error listing prompts: {e}")

                # Example: List available tools
                try:
                    tools = await session.list_tools()
                    print("\nAvailable Tools:")
                    if tools:
                         for t in tools:
                             print(f"- {t.name}: {t.description}")
                    else:
                         print("  (No tools available)")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error listing tools: {e}")

                # Example: Get and trigger a specific prompt (if one exists)
                # prompt_name_to_trigger = "example-prompt" # Replace with an actual prompt name
                # try:
                #     print(f"\nGetting prompt: {prompt_name_to_trigger}")
                #     prompt_details = await session.get_prompt(
                #         prompt_name_to_trigger,
                #         arguments={"arg1": "client_value"} # Provide required arguments
                #     )
                #     print("Prompt Details:", prompt_details)
                #     # Actually triggering the prompt often involves sending its
                #     # messages back into the conversation flow via your agent,
                #     # but the exact mechanism depends on your client application's logic.
                #     # A simple way might be just to display it or feed it to the LLM.
                # except Exception as e:
                #     print(f"Error getting prompt '{prompt_name_to_trigger}': {e}")


                # Keep the client running to handle server interactions/callbacks
                print("\nClient running. Waiting for server interactions or termination...")
                # In a real app, you'd have a loop or event system here.
                # For this example, we'll just wait indefinitely until manually stopped
                # or the server connection closes.
                await asyncio.Event().wait() # Keep running until interrupted

    except ConnectionRefusedError:
        print("Connection refused. Is the server running?")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Command '{server_params.command}' not found. Is it in your PATH?")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during client execution: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(run_client())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nClient stopped.")
```

**4. Debugging Your Client**

Refer to the [Debugging Tools documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging). Key techniques include:

*   **Logging:** Add extensive `print` statements or use Python's `logging` module within your client code, especially inside the `sampling_callback` and around `session` method calls.
*   **MCP Debugger:** Use the `mcp debug` command-line tool. You can pipe the communication between your client and server through it to inspect the JSON messages being exchanged.
    ```bash
    # Example: Debugging a stdio connection
    mcp debug -- python my_client_script.py -- server python my_mcp_server.py
    ```
    This command runs the debugger, which then runs your client, which in turn runs the server, allowing the debugger to sit in the middle and show you the traffic.
*   **Inspect Payloads:** Carefully examine the `request` object in your `sampling_callback` and the responses from `session` methods to ensure data is flowing as expected.

**In Summary:**

Building an MCP client involves:
1.  Defining how to connect to the server (`StdioServerParameters`).
2.  Implementing the core agent/LLM logic within the `sampling_callback`.
3.  Using `stdio_client` (or equivalent) to establish the connection.
4.  Creating a `ClientSession` with the connection streams and your callback.
5.  Calling `session.initialize()` to start the communication.
6.  Using other `session` methods (`list_prompts`, `call_tool`, etc.) to interact with the server as needed by your application's logic.
7.  Leveraging debugging tools like `mcp debug` and logging to troubleshoot.

## Questions related to AGENTS CREATION
NOW, let's clarify the concept of the "agent" in the context of the MCP Python SDK and your client application.

1.  **Where is the agent located? Who has the agent?**
    *   The "agent" isn't a separate, pre-built component that you import from the `mcp` library.
    *   **The "agent" *is* the logic you write inside the `sampling_callback` function within *your* MCP client application.**
    *   So, **you**, the developer of the MCP client, create and "have" the agent logic. It resides directly within your client's codebase. The `mcp` library provides the *framework* for this logic to be called by the server, but not the logic itself.

2.  **How does it work here?**
    *   **Server Request:** When the MCP server needs the client's "intelligence" to proceed (e.g., to generate a response in a conversation, decide what to do next), it sends a specific request (`workspace/createMessage`) to the client over the established connection.
    *   **Client Session Trigger:** Your running `ClientSession` in the client application receives this request.
    *   **Callback Invocation:** The `ClientSession` automatically calls the `sampling_callback` function that you provided when you created the session. It passes the necessary information, like the conversation history (`request.messages`), to your callback.
    *   **Agent Logic Execution:** Your code inside the `sampling_callback` runs. This is where the "agent" acts:
        *   It analyzes the received messages/context.
        *   **Crucially, it typically calls an external Large Language Model (LLM)** – this could be OpenAI's API, Anthropic's API, a locally running model, or any other service capable of processing the conversation and generating a response or decision.
        *   It takes the result from the LLM (or its own internal logic).
        *   It formats that result into the required `CreateMessageResult` object (specifying the role, content, stop reason, etc.).
    *   **Response to Server:** Your callback returns the `CreateMessageResult` object to the `ClientSession`.
    *   **Transmission:** The `ClientSession` sends this result back to the MCP server.

3.  **How to tweak and fine-tune it to work something specific?**
    *   Since *you* write the code in the `sampling_callback`, you have full control. Tweaking involves changing that code:
        *   **Change the LLM:** Point your callback to a different LLM API endpoint or use a different model name (e.g., switch from `gpt-3.5-turbo` to `gpt-4` or `claude-3-opus-20240229`).
        *   **Modify the System Prompt:** Change the instructions you give to the LLM *before* sending the conversation history.
        *   **Alter Message Formatting:** Change how you present the `request.messages` to your chosen LLM.
        *   **Add Pre-processing Logic:** Before calling the LLM, filter messages, inject extra context, or apply rules.
        *   **Add Post-processing Logic:** After getting the LLM response, parse it, validate it, censor parts, or format it differently before creating the `CreateMessageResult`.
        *   **Implement Non-LLM Logic:** For simple cases, your callback might not even need to call an LLM. It could use `if/else` statements or other rules to generate a response directly.

4.  **How can I use an mcp client in my GUI application...? ...I guess I should be having an agent, right?**
    *   **Yes, absolutely.** Your GUI application *becomes* the MCP client. To make it interact intelligently with an MCP server, you need to implement the "agent" logic (the `sampling_callback`).
    *   **Integration:**
        *   Your GUI application (built with Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, etc.) would run the MCP client logic, likely in a separate thread or using `asyncio` integrated with the GUI's event loop (libraries exist for this, e.g., `quamash` for Qt).
        *   It would handle setting up the `StdioServerParameters` (or other connection method).
        *   It would define the `sampling_callback` function, which contains your agent logic (including calls to your chosen LLM).
        *   It would start and manage the `ClientSession`.
        *   **GUI -> MCP:** User input in the GUI (like typing a message) would trigger your code to potentially send a message *through* the `ClientSession` to the server. The server might then respond, possibly triggering your `sampling_callback`.
        *   **MCP -> GUI:** When your `sampling_callback` produces a result (like text from the LLM), your client code would take that result and update the GUI elements (e.g., display the assistant's message in a chat window).

5.  **How is that agent created? Who wrote the code for that agent here?**
    *   **It's created by you writing Python code.** Specifically, the code within the function you designate as the `sampling_callback`.
    *   **You**, the developer of the client application, write the agent's code.

6.  **In the modules and packages imported above, are there any agents available in there already?**
    *   **No.** The `mcp` package itself **does not provide a pre-built agent or LLM**. It provides the communication protocol structure (`ClientSession`, message types, connection helpers like `stdio_client`).
    *   You need to bring your own intelligence – typically by integrating calls to an external LLM service (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc.) or a local model within your `sampling_callback`.

In essence, MCP defines *how* a client and server should talk, including when the server can ask the client to "think" (generate content). The `sampling_callback` is the designated spot in your client code where you implement *how* your client "thinks," which usually involves calling an LLM you choose and configure.

## Now the confusion between the MCP python sdk and openai-agents-sdk


Okay, let's clear up the confusion. You've encountered two different Python SDKs that deal with "agents" and the "Model Context Protocol (MCP)," but they serve distinct purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction.

1.  **`modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` (The one we discussed before):**
    *   **Primary Goal:** To provide the low-level building blocks for implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** itself. It helps you create clients and servers that can *speak* MCP.
    *   **The "Agent":** As we established, in this SDK, the "agent" isn't a pre-built component. It's the **custom logic you write** within the `sampling_callback` function of your client. You are responsible for defining how the client responds, which typically involves calling an external LLM.
    *   **MCP Role:** Primarily used to build **MCP clients** (like your GUI application needing to connect to a server) or custom **MCP servers**.
    *   **Abstraction Level:** Lower-level, focused on protocol implementation and communication pipes.

2.  **`openai/openai-agents-python` (The new one you linked):**
    *   **Primary Goal:** To provide a higher-level framework specifically for building **agentic applications**, particularly using OpenAI models (though extensible via LiteLLM - [docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/models/litellm/)). It simplifies creating agents with instructions, tools, and complex interaction patterns like handoffs between agents ([docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/)).
    *   **The "Agent":** This SDK provides an explicit `Agent` class ([docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents/)). You define an agent by instantiating this class, giving it instructions, tools, etc. The SDK's `Runner` handles the underlying loop of calling the LLM, managing tool use, and processing responses ([docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/running_agents/)). **You configure the agent; the SDK runs it.**
    *   **MCP Role:** This SDK can **expose an agent (or a system of agents) *as* an MCP server** ([docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/)). This means an application built *with* the OpenAI Agents SDK can *act as* the server that a standard MCP client (like one built with the *other* SDK) connects to.
    *   **Abstraction Level:** Higher-level, focused on agent definition, orchestration, and features like guardrails and tracing.

**Analogy:**

*   Think of the `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` as providing the **telephone lines and the rules for how to speak** (the MCP protocol). Your `sampling_callback` is you picking up the phone and deciding what to say, possibly after consulting an expert (your external LLM).
*   Think of the `openai-agents-python` SDK as providing a **pre-built robot assistant (the `Agent` class) that already knows how to use the phone (or expose its own phone line via MCP)**. You just tell the robot its job (instructions), give it tools, and tell it which other robots it can delegate tasks to (handoffs). The SDK handles the robot's internal thinking process (calling the OpenAI LLM) for you.

**Can they be used together? Yes!**

The most common way they work together is in a **client-server relationship**:

1.  You use the **`openai-agents-python` SDK** to build your sophisticated agent application (maybe a "Research Bot" or "Customer Service System" as in their examples - [docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/examples/)).
2.  You use the MCP server functionality *within* the `openai-agents-python` SDK to expose your agent application as an MCP server.
3.  You use the **`modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk`** to build your **client** application (e.g., your GUI). This client connects to the MCP server you created in step 2. The `sampling_callback` in *this* client might be simpler, perhaps just relaying user input or handling basic interactions, because the complex agent logic resides on the server built with the OpenAI SDK.

**Example:**

**Scenario:** Create an agent using `openai-agents-python` that acts as a simple calculator and expose it as an MCP server. Then, create a client using `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` to connect to it.

**Part 1: Server using `openai-agents-python` (e.g., `calculator_server.py`)**

```python
# Needs: pip install openai-agents uvicorn sse-starlette
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

import asyncio
from agents import Agent, tool
from agents.mcp import serve # Import the MCP server utility from openai-agents
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Define the input schema for the tool
class AddInput(BaseModel):
    a: int = Field(..., description="First number to add")
    b: int = Field(..., description="Second number to add")

# Define the tool using the @tool decorator
@tool(AddInput)
async def add_numbers(ctx, input_data: AddInput) -> str:
    """Adds two numbers together."""
    result = input_data.a + input_data.b
    return f"The sum of {input_data.a} and {input_data.b} is {result}"

# Define the agent
calculator_agent = Agent(
    name="CalculatorAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful calculator. Use the available tools to perform calculations. Respond only with the final result string provided by the tool.",
    tools=[add_numbers], # Provide the tool to the agent
)

async def main():
    print("Starting MCP server for CalculatorAgent...")
    # Serve this agent as an MCP server using the utility from openai-agents
    # This will run a web server (uvicorn) exposing the MCP endpoint
    await serve(calculator_agent) # Default host/port usually http://127.0.0.1:8000

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Note: 'serve' usually runs its own async loop with uvicorn.
    # Running it directly might be sufficient, or you might need to check
    # the specific `serve` implementation details in the openai-agents docs/source
    # for how it's intended to be launched from a script.
    # For simplicity here, we'll assume running the script starts the server via `serve`.
    # A common pattern might be to run this script using uvicorn directly:
    # uvicorn calculator_server:calculator_agent --factory agents.mcp:create_app
    # OR rely on `await serve(calculator_agent)` if it handles launching.
    # Let's stick with the await serve pattern as shown in some examples conceptually.
     try:
        asyncio.run(main())
     except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Server stopped.")
     # Running `python calculator_server.py` might require `uvicorn` to be installed
     # and potentially configuration within `serve` or how it's called.
     # Check `openai-agents` MCP documentation for the exact run command.
     # A likely command might be: mcp run calculator_server.py (if using mcp cli tools)
     # Or potentially running via uvicorn if `serve` sets up a FastAPI/Starlette app.
     # Let's assume for now `python calculator_server.py` gets it running via `serve`.

```
*(Self-correction: Launching the server built with `openai-agents`'s `serve` might require specific `uvicorn` commands or using helper scripts/CLI tools provided by `openai-agents` or `mcp`. The `asyncio.run(main())` might not be the final way, refer to their specific MCP server docs. The core idea is defining the agent and using `serve`.)*

**Part 2: Client using `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` (e.g., `mcp_client.py`)**

```python
# Needs: pip install modelcontextprotocol-python requests httpx sse-starlette
# Assumes the server from Part 1 is running (e.g., on http://127.0.0.1:8000)

import asyncio
import mcp.types as types
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.http import http_client # Use HTTP client to connect

# This basic callback just prints messages and lets the server handle agent logic
async def simple_sampling_callback(
    request: types.CreateMessageRequestParams,
) -> types.CreateMessageResult:
    print(f"-> Client Callback Received: Need response for {len(request.messages)} messages.")
    # In this scenario, the client doesn't need its *own* LLM.
    # The server (built with openai-agents) handles the core logic.
    # We might just return a simple acknowledgement or potentially

In this setup:
*   `calculator_server.py` uses `openai-agents-python` to define the agent and its tool, and *acts as* the MCP Server.
*   `mcp_client.py` uses `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` to connect *to* that server as a standard MCP client. The complex calculation logic lives within the server agent.

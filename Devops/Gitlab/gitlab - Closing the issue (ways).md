To refer to a pipeline or merge request in GitLab issue comments while closing an issue, you can use GitLab's built-in referencing syntax. Here are the best ways to link them:

1. Referencing a pipeline:
   Use the `#` symbol followed by the pipeline ID. For example:
   ```
   Closing this issue. Fixed in pipeline #123456
   ```

2. Referencing a merge request:
   Use the `!` symbol followed by the merge request ID. For example:
   ```
   Closing this issue. Implemented in !789
   ```

3. Automatically closing an issue with a merge request:
   In the merge request description or commit message, use one of these keywords followed by the issue number:
   ```
   Closes #42
   Fixes #42
   Resolves #42
   ```
   This will automatically close the issue when the merge request is merged.

4. Combining references:
   You can combine multiple references in a single comment:
   ```
   Closing this issue. Fixed in pipeline #123456 and implemented in !789
   ```

5. Using cross-project references:
   If the pipeline or merge request is in a different project, use the full path:
   ```
   group/project#123456 (for pipelines)
   group/project!789 (for merge requests)
   ```

6. Linking to specific pipeline jobs:
   Use the `#` symbol, pipeline ID, and job name:
   ```
   Issue fixed in #123456 (job_name)
   ```

These methods will create clickable links in GitLab, making it easy for team members to navigate between related issues, merge requests, and pipelines. Using these references helps maintain traceability and provides context for issue resolutions.

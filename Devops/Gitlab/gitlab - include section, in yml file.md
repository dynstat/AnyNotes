### Types of `include`

GitLab supports several methods to include external YAML files into your main `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

1. **Local Includes**: Include files from the same repository.
2. **Project Includes**: Include files from other projects within the same GitLab instance.
3. **Remote Includes**: Include files hosted on external URLs.
4. **Template Includes**: Use predefined templates provided by GitLab.

#### 1. Local Includes

Include YAML files stored within the same repository.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: 'path/to/file.yml'
```

**Example:**
```yaml
include:
  - local: '/ci-templates/deploy.yml'
  - local: '/ci-templates/test.yml'
```

#### 2. Project Includes

Include YAML files from other projects within the same GitLab instance.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
include:
  - project: 'group/project'
    file: '/path/to/file.yml'
    ref: 'branch-or-tag'
```

**Example:**
```yaml
include:
  - project: 'my-group/shared-ci-templates'
    file: '/templates/build.yml'
    ref: 'v1.0.0'
```

#### 3. Remote Includes

Include YAML files hosted on external URLs.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://example.com/path/to/file.yml'
```

**Example:**
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example/repo/master/ci-templates/deploy.yml'
```

#### 4. Template Includes

Use predefined templates provided by GitLab.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
include:
  - template: 'Template Name'
```

**Example:**
```yaml
include:
  - template: 'Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml'
  - template: 'Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml'
```

### Use Cases

- **Reusability**: Share common configurations like build, test, or deploy stages across multiple projects.
- **Maintainability**: Update CI/CD configurations in one place and have changes propagate to all dependent projects.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex pipelines into smaller, manageable files.
- **Standardization**: Ensure consistency in CI/CD practices across an organization.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Using Local Includes

Suppose you have a repository with the following structure:
```
.
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
└── ci-templates
    ├── build.yml
    └── deploy.yml
```

**`ci-templates/build.yml`:**
```yaml
.build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."
    - make build
```

**`ci-templates/deploy.yml`:**
```yaml
.deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application..."
    - make deploy
```

**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

include:
  - local: 'ci-templates/build.yml'
  - local: 'ci-templates/deploy.yml'

build:
  extends: .build-job

deploy:
  extends: .deploy-job
```

#### Example 2: Using Remote Includes

**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example/repo/master/ci-templates/test.yml'

stages:
  - test

test:
  extends: .test-job
```

**`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example/repo/master/ci-templates/test.yml`:**
```yaml
.test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - make test
```

#### Example 3: Using Project Includes

Assume you have a shared CI templates project `gitlab-org/shared-ci-templates`.

**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - project: 'gitlab-org/shared-ci-templates'
    file: '/templates/security-scan.yml'
    ref: 'main'

stages:
  - security

security_scan:
  extends: .security-scan
```

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Includes Organized**: Store included files in a dedicated directory (e.g., `ci-templates/`) to maintain clarity.
2. **Use Anchors and Extensions**: Utilize YAML anchors (`&`) and extensions (`*`) to define reusable parts within included files.
3. **Version Control**: When using project or remote includes, specify a `ref` to lock the included configuration to a specific branch or tag, ensuring stability.
4. **Minimize Remote Dependencies**: Prefer local or project includes over remote includes to reduce external dependencies and potential security risks.
5. **Document Includes**: Clearly comment on included files to provide context on their purpose and usage.
6. **Test Included Files Separately**: Ensure that included YAML files are valid and function as expected before integrating them into the main pipeline.
7. **Limit Nesting**: Avoid deeply nested includes to prevent complexity and maintain readability.

### Practical Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Multi-Project Architecture with Shared CI Templates

**Use Case:**
An organization has multiple projects that share common CI/CD processes like building, testing, and deploying applications. Instead of duplicating the CI configurations across all projects, they create a central repository for shared CI templates.

**Setup:**
1. **Shared Repository (`shared-ci-templates`):**
   ```
   shared-ci-templates/
   ├── build.yml
   ├── test.yml
   └── deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Main Project `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
   ```yaml
   include:
     - project: 'my-group/shared-ci-templates'
       file: '/build.yml'
       ref: 'main'
     - project: 'my-group/shared-ci-templates'
       file: '/test.yml'
       ref: 'main'
     - project: 'my-group/shared-ci-templates'
       file: '/deploy.yml'
       ref: 'main'

   stages:
     - build
     - test
     - deploy

   build:
     extends: .build-job

   test:
     extends: .test-job

   deploy:
     extends: .deploy-job
   ```

**Benefits:**
- Centralized management of CI/CD processes.
- Consistency across multiple projects.
- Easier updates and maintenance.

#### Scenario 2: Incorporating GitLab’s Predefined Templates

**Use Case:**
Leverage GitLab’s built-in CI/CD templates for common tasks like security scanning, SAST (Static Application Security Testing), and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing).

**Setup:**
**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - template: 'Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml'
  - template: 'Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml'

stages:
  - test
  - security

sast:
  stage: security
  extends: .sast

dast:
  stage: security
  extends: .dast
```

**Benefits:**
- Utilize well-maintained and updated security practices.
- Save time by using predefined configurations.
- Enhance security without extensive setup.

#### Scenario 3: Remote Includes for Dynamic Configuration

**Use Case:**
Include configuration files maintained outside the GitLab repository, such as configurations managed by a separate team or fetched from an external source.

**Setup:**
**`.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://example.com/ci-templates/build.yml'
  - remote: 'https://example.com/ci-templates/deploy.yml'

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build:
  extends: .build-job

deploy:
  extends: .deploy-job
```

**Benefits:**
- Dynamic updates to CI configurations without modifying each project.
- Centralized control for external teams.
- Flexibility to integrate configurations from various sources.

**Caution:**
- Ensure the external sources are secure and trusted.
- Use specific `ref` or commit hashes when possible to lock configurations.

### Practical Use Cases

1. **Reusability Across Multiple Projects**
   - Maintain a centralized repository of CI/CD templates (e.g., build, test, deploy jobs).
   - Include these templates in multiple projects to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

2. **Organizing Complex Pipelines**
   - Break down a large `.gitlab-ci.yml` into smaller, more manageable files.
   - Example: Separate files for build, test, deploy stages.

3. **Leveraging GitLab’s Security Templates**
   - Use predefined security scanning templates like SAST, DAST to enhance your CI/CD pipeline without manual configuration.

4. **Dynamic Configuration Management**
   - Fetch CI/CD configurations from external sources or other repositories, allowing dynamic updates without modifying each individual project.

---

### Best Practices

1. **Use Local Includes for Repository-Specific Configurations**
   - Keep templates that are unique to a project within the same repository for easier access and maintenance.

2. **Centralize Common Configurations Using Project Includes**
   - Store shared CI/CD logic in a dedicated repository and include them across multiple projects to ensure consistency.

3. **Prefer Project Includes Over Remote Includes**
   - **Security:** Project includes are hosted within your GitLab instance, reducing the risk associated with fetching configurations from external URLs.
   - **Reliability:** Remote URLs might be unavailable or change over time, breaking your pipeline.

4. **Lock Includes to Specific References**
   - Always specify a `ref` (branch or tag) when using project or remote includes to ensure pipeline stability.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     include:
       - project: 'my-group/shared-ci-templates'
         file: '/templates/build.yml'
         ref: 'v1.0.0'
     ```

5. **Organize Included Files Effectively**
   - Structure your included files logically within directories (e.g., `ci-templates/`) to enhance readability and maintainability.

6. **Document Included Configurations**
   - Clearly comment on what each included file does, especially if they are shared across multiple projects.

7. **Validate Included Files Separately**
   - Ensure that external YAML files are valid and function as expected before integrating them into your main pipeline.

8. **Use YAML Anchors and Aliases for Reusability**
   - Within included files, utilize YAML anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to define reusable components.

9. **Minimize the Number of Includes**
   - While modularization is beneficial, excessively breaking down configurations can lead to complexity. Strike a balance between modularity and simplicity.

10. **Secure Remote Includes**
    - If using remote includes, ensure the sources are trusted and secure to prevent malicious configurations from affecting your pipelines.

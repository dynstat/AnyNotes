# CI/CD with GitLab

## 1. Version Control Fundamentals (Git Basics)

### What is Version Control and Why It's Needed

**Version Control** is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is essential for:

- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
- **History Tracking**: Keeps a history of changes, who made them, and why.
- **Backup**: Safeguards against data loss.
- **Branching and Merging**: Allows experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

### Basic Git Concepts

#### Repository

A **Repository** (or **Repo**) is a storage space for your project. It can be local to a folder on your computer or hosted on platforms like GitLab.

- **Local Repository**: Stored on your machine.
- **Remote Repository**: Stored on a server (e.g., GitLab).

#### Commits

A **Commit** is a snapshot of your repository at a specific time. Each commit has a unique ID and includes a commit message describing the changes.

#### Branches

A **Branch** is a parallel version of the repository. It allows you to work on different features or fixes independently.

- **Master/Main Branch**: The primary branch where the source code is always in a deployable state.
- **Feature Branch**: Used to develop a specific feature or fix.

#### Merge

**Merging** is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is commonly used to bring feature branches into the main branch.

#### Push/Pull

- **Push**: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository.
- **Pull**: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into your local repository.

### Hands-on Practice with Basic Git Commands

Let's walk through some basic Git commands using **Git Bash** on **Windows**.

#### Initializing a Repository

```bash
git init
```

- **Explanation**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

#### Adding Files to Staging

```bash
git add .
```

- **Explanation**: Adds all changed files in the current directory to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.

#### Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- **Explanation**: Commits the staged changes with a message describing the commit.

#### Viewing Branches

```bash
git branch
```

- **Explanation**: Lists all the branches in the repository and highlights the current branch.

#### Creating a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

- **Explanation**: Creates and switches to a new branch named `feature-branch`.

#### Merging Branches

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

- **Explanation**: Switches to the `main` branch and merges changes from `feature-branch` into it.

#### Pushing Changes to Remote Repository

```bash
git push origin main
```

- **Explanation**: Pushes committed changes from the local `main` branch to the remote repository named `origin`.

#### Pulling Changes from Remote Repository

```bash
git pull origin main
```

- **Explanation**: Fetches and merges changes from the remote `main` branch into the local `main` branch.

## 3. DevOps Concepts

### What is DevOps

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combine software development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**). It aims to shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

### DevOps Lifecycle

1. **Plan**: Define the scope and requirements.
2. **Develop**: Code the software.
3. **Build**: Compile the code into executable artifacts.
4. **Test**: Validate the quality of the build.
5. **Release**: Deploy the build to production.
6. **Deploy**: Make the software available to users.
7. **Operate**: Monitor and maintain the software.
8. **Monitor**: Continuously observe performance and usage.

### Importance of Automation

Automation in DevOps enhances:

- **Speed**: Faster development and deployment cycles.
- **Consistency**: Reduces human errors and ensures repeatability.
- **Efficiency**: Frees up time for more valuable tasks.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales processes to handle growth.

### Development, Testing, and Production Environments

- **Development Environment**: Where developers write and test code.
- **Testing Environment**: Where code is tested for bugs and issues.
- **Production Environment**: Live environment where the application is accessible to users.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Concept

**Infrastructure as Code** involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts rather than manual processes.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes can be tracked and reviewed.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures environments are reproducible.
  - **Scalability**: Easily manage complex infrastructures.

---

## 4. CI/CD Fundamentals

### What is Continuous Integration

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and automated tests to detect errors quickly.

### What is Continuous Delivery/Deployment

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Extends CI by automating the release process, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. Requires manual approval for deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automates the entire release process, deploying every change that passes automated tests directly to production.

### Benefits of CI/CD

- **Faster Release Rates**: Automates repetitive tasks, speeding up the release process.
- **Improved Quality**: Early detection of bugs through automated testing.
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller, incremental changes are easier to manage and troubleshoot.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitates better integration among team members.

### Pipeline Concepts

A **CI/CD Pipeline** is a series of automated steps that code changes go through, from integration to deployment.

- **Stages**: Logical divisions within the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
- **Jobs**: Individual tasks within a stage (e.g., Compile code, Run tests).
- **Artifacts**: Files generated by jobs that are passed between stages.

### Automated Testing

**Automated Testing** involves using software tools to run tests on code automatically, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

- **Types of Tests**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Test individual components or functions.
  - **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components.
  - **End-to-End Tests**: Test the complete workflow from start to finish.

### Automated Deployment

**Automated Deployment** involves using scripts and tools to deploy applications to environments without manual intervention, ensuring consistency and speed.

## 5. GitLab CI/CD Specific Topics

### `.gitlab-ci.yml` File Structure

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline configuration. It specifies the stages, jobs, scripts, and other settings.

#### Basic Structure

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
```

### Pipeline Configuration

#### Example `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml: Defines the CI/CD pipeline for the project

stages:
  - build      # Stage for building the application
  - test       # Stage for running tests
  - deploy     # Stage for deploying the application

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."
    - npm install  # Example command to install dependencies
    - npm run build  # Example build command
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/     # Save the build artifacts
  tags:
    - docker      # Specify runner tags if needed

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - npm test     # Example command to run tests
  dependencies:
    - build-job     # Depend on the build-job to use its artifacts

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - ./deploy.sh  # Example deployment script
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://your-production-url.com
  only:
    - main          # Deploy only when changes are pushed to the main branch
```

**Explanation**:

- **stages**: Defines the sequence of stages in the pipeline.
- **build-job**:
  - **stage**: Specifies the stage name.
  - **script**: Commands to execute.
  - **artifacts**: Files to pass to subsequent jobs.
  - **tags**: Specifies GitLab Runner tags for job execution.
- **test-job**:
  - **dependencies**: Ensures `build-job` artifacts are available.
- **deploy-job**:
  - **environment**: Defines the deployment environment.
  - **only**: Specifies when to run the job.

### GitLab Runners

**GitLab Runners** are the agents that execute the jobs defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. They can be:

- **Shared Runners**: Available for all projects in GitLab.
- **Specific Runners**: Dedicated to a particular project or group.

#### Registering a Runner on Windows

1. **Download Runner**:
   - Visit [GitLab Runner Downloads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/releases) and download the Windows binary.

2. **Install Runner**:
   - Extract the binary and place it in a directory (e.g., `C:\GitLab-Runner`).

3. **Register Runner**:
   - Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator.
   - Navigate to the runner directory:
     ```bash
     cd C:\GitLab-Runner
     ```
   - Run the registration command:
     ```bash
     gitlab-runner register
     ```
   - **Follow the Prompts**:
     - **URL**: Enter your GitLab instance URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.com/`).
     - **Token**: Obtain from your GitLab project under **Settings > CI/CD > Runners**.
     - **Description**: Describe the runner (e.g., `Windows Runner`).
     - **Tags**: Assign tags if needed (e.g., `docker`).
     - **Executor**: Choose the executor type (e.g., `shell`).

4. **Start Runner**:
   - Install as a service:
     ```bash
     gitlab-runner install
     gitlab-runner start
     ```

### Environment Variables

**Environment Variables** are key-value pairs that provide configuration options to the pipeline without hardcoding them.

#### Defining Variables in GitLab

1. **Navigate to Project Settings**:
   - Go to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.

2. **Add Variable**:
   - Click **"Add variable"**.
   - **Key**: Variable name (e.g., `API_KEY`).
   - **Value**: Variable value (e.g., `123456`).
   - **Type**: Variable type (`Variable`, `File`, etc.).
   - **Environment Scope**: Specify the environments where the variable applies.
   - **Protection and Masking**: Protect variables to restrict access to protected branches or tags. Mask to hide the value in job logs.

#### Using Variables in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying using API key: $API_KEY"
    - ./deploy.sh --key $API_KEY
```

**Explanation**:

- `$API_KEY` accesses the environment variable defined in GitLab settings.

### Artifacts

**Artifacts** are files generated by jobs that can be used in later stages or downloaded.

#### Defining Artifacts in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/          # Include all files in the 'dist' directory
    expire_in: 1 week  # Set expiration for artifacts
```

**Explanation**:

- **paths**: Specifies the directories or files to include as artifacts.
- **expire_in**: Duration after which artifacts are deleted.

### Cache and Dependencies

**Cache** stores files between jobs to speed up the pipeline by avoiding repeated downloads or builds.

#### Defining Cache in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/   # Cache the 'node_modules' directory

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  cache:
    policy: pull-push  # Pull cache before job and push after job
```

**Explanation**:

- **policy**:
  - **pull-push**: Default; pulls cache before the job and pushes any updates after.
  - **pull**: Only pulls cache before the job.
  - **push**: Only pushes cache after the job.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Diagram**:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A[Commit Code] --> B[Build Stage];
      B --> C[Test Stage];
      C --> D[Deploy Stage];
      D --> E[Production]
  ```
- **Version Control Workflow**:
  ```mermaid
  gitGraph
     commit
     branch feature
     commit
     commit
     checkout main
     merge feature
     commit
  ```

### 3. Provide Plenty of Hands-on Exercises

- **Lab Sessions**: Allocate time for practical exercises during lessons.

## Common Pitfalls to Address

### 1. Git Merge Conflicts

**Issue**: Occurs when changes from different branches conflict during merging.

**Solution**:
- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Communicate with team members about changes.
  - Pull the latest changes before starting work.
- **Resolving Conflicts**:
  - Use Git tools to identify and resolve conflicts manually.
  - After resolving, add and commit the changes.

**Example**:
```bash
# After a merge conflict occurs
git status
# Identify conflicted files
# Edit conflicted files to resolve conflicts
git add resolved-file.js
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in resolved-file.js"
```

### 2. Pipeline Configuration Issues

**Issue**: Errors in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file causing pipeline failures.

**Solution**:
- **Validate YAML Syntax**: Use online YAML validators or GitLab's CI Lint tool.
  - Navigate to **CI/CD > Pipelines > CI Lint** in GitLab.
  - Paste `.gitlab-ci.yml` content to validate.
- **Check Logs**: Review pipeline job logs to identify errors.
- **Refer to Documentation**: Consult [GitLab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) for correct syntax and configurations.

### 3. Environment Variable Management

**Issue**: Improper handling of sensitive data like API keys.

**Solution**:
- **Use GitLab Variables**: Store sensitive information in GitLab's CI/CD settings as protected and masked variables.
- **Avoid Hardcoding**: Do not include secrets directly in code or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to variables to authorized personnel.

### 4. Security Best Practices

**Issue**: Vulnerabilities due to insecure code or pipeline configurations.

**Solution**:
- **Code Reviews**: Implement thorough code reviews to catch security issues.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Use tools like **ESLint**, **SonarQube** to analyze code for vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
- **Limit Access**: Control access to repositories and pipelines using GitLab's permissions.

### 5. Pipeline Optimization

**Issue**: Slow or inefficient pipelines affecting development speed.

**Solution**:
- **Parallel Jobs**: Run jobs concurrently where possible.
- **Cache Effectively**: Utilize caching to avoid redundant tasks.
- **Limit Artifacts**: Only store necessary artifacts to reduce size and transfer time.
- **Optimize Scripts**: Ensure scripts are efficient and avoid unnecessary steps.

### 6. Error Handling in Pipelines

**Issue**: Unhandled errors causing pipeline failures.

**Solution**:
- **Set Error Policies**: Define how pipelines should react to failures (e.g., continue on failure, retry).
- **Implement Notifications**: Configure alerts for pipeline failures to notify the team.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design pipelines to handle partial failures without complete shutdowns.
- **Use Try-Catch in Scripts**: Handle script errors gracefully to manage unexpected issues.

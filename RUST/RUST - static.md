This error arises because the function `get_strings()` returns a fixed-size array of string slices `&str`. In Rust, when you use `&str` without specifying a lifetime, the compiler requires you to clarify how long the references returned by the function are valid.

### Explanation of the Error:

The error message you encountered is about lifetimes. In Rust, every reference (`&T`) has an associated lifetime, which tells the compiler how long that reference is valid. Here’s why this matters:

1. **`&str` is a reference to a string slice**: A `&str` is a borrowed reference to a part of a string. It needs to have a known lifetime to indicate how long it will be valid. Since `&str` is a borrowed reference, it must point to an existing memory location containing a valid string. For instance, you might be borrowing from a `String` or a string literal.

2. **Function Scope and Lifetimes**: When `get_strings()` returns an array of `&str`, the compiler needs to know the lifetime of those references:
   - If they reference data inside the function scope (e.g., created dynamically within the function), returning those references would be invalid because they point to data that would be destroyed as soon as the function exits.
   - The compiler assumes that references you return might outlive the data they point to, so it requires a lifetime annotation or some guarantee that the data will be valid for as long as the returned reference is used.

### Why Adding `'static` Solves the Issue

In your case, you are returning string slices of string literals:
```rust
fn get_strings() -> [&'static str; 2] {
    ["Hello", "World"]
}
```

Adding `'static` means that the string slices you are returning have a lifetime that lasts for the entire duration of the program. String literals like `"Hello"` and `"World"` are stored in the binary of your program and have a `'static` lifetime by default. This tells the compiler that these references are valid for as long as they are needed.

### Without `'static`, Why Does the Error Occur?

When you omit `'static`, the compiler doesn’t know how long the returned `&str` references will be valid. It cannot assume `'static` by default because, in general, the references could point to data that might not live long enough. Since there is no lifetime specified for these references, it raises an error, as Rust's safety guarantees prevent returning dangling references (references to invalid memory).

### Two Solutions:

1. **Using `'static` Lifetime**:
   ```rust
   fn get_strings() -> [&'static str; 2] {
       ["Hello", "World"]
   }

   fn main() {
       let arr = get_strings();
       for s in arr.iter() {
           println!("{}", s);
       }
   }
   ```
   This works because string literals are guaranteed to live for the `'static` lifetime.

2. **Returning `String` Instead**:
   If you want more flexibility, you can return owned `String` values instead of references:
   ```rust
   fn get_strings() -> [String; 2] {
       [String::from("Hello"), String::from("World")]
   }

   fn main() {
       let arr = get_strings();
       for s in arr.iter() {
           println!("{}", s);
       }
   }
   ```
   Here, `String` is an owned type, so the data lives independently of any other scope. You can move it, modify it, and return it from functions without worrying about lifetimes.

### Summary of Lifetimes:

1. **Lifetimes in References**: All references (`&T` and `&mut T`) have lifetimes. When a function returns references, you must specify how long they are valid.
2. **`'static` Lifetime**: The `'static` lifetime means that the reference lives for the entire duration of the program. String literals have a `'static` lifetime.
3. **Owned Data (`String`)**: When you use owned data types like `String`, you don’t need to worry about specifying lifetimes when returning them from functions.

The error messages indicate that the `rustc` and `cargo` components are not available for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target under the `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain. This is expected because `rustc` and `cargo` are typically not target-specific components; they are part of the toolchain itself.

Here's how you can address this:

1. **Install the GNU Toolchain Separately:**
   You need to install the GNU toolchain separately, which will include `rustc` and `cargo` for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target. You can do this by installing the entire toolchain:

   ```bash
   rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
   ```

   This command will install the GNU toolchain, including all necessary components like `rustc` and `cargo`.

2. **Switch to the GNU Toolchain:**
   If you want to use the GNU toolchain by default, you can switch to it:

   ```bash
   rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, verify that the GNU toolchain is correctly installed and set as default:

   ```bash
   rustup show
   ```

   This command will show the active toolchain and its components.

4. **Rebuild Your Project:**
   Once the GNU toolchain is installed, rebuild your project to ensure it uses the correct toolchain:

   ```bash
   cargo clean
   cargo build
   ```

5. **Configure VSCode:**
   Ensure that your VSCode is configured to use the correct toolchain. You might need to adjust your `settings.json` or `launch.json` to specify the GNU toolchain if necessary.

By installing the `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` toolchain, you should have all the necessary components for building and debugging your Rust projects using the GNU target. If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your environment variables and paths are correctly set up to point to the new toolchain.

## **2.4 Creating Your First Rust Project**

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" project to verify that your environment is set up correctly.

### **2.4.1 Using Cargo to Create a New Project**

`Cargo` is Rust's build system and package manager. It simplifies project creation, dependency management, and more.

**Creating a New Project:**

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - In VS Code, open the integrated terminal by pressing `` Ctrl + ` ``.

2. **Run Cargo Command:**
   ```powershell
   cargo new hello_world
   ```

   This command creates a new directory named `hello_world` with the following structure:

   ```
   hello_world/
   ├── Cargo.toml
   └── src
       └── main.rs
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```powershell
   cd hello_world
   ```

### **2.4.2 Understanding the Project Structure**

- **Cargo.toml:**
  - The configuration file for your project.
  - Contains metadata, dependencies, and build configurations.

- **src/main.rs:**
  - The main Rust source file.
  - Contains the entry point of the application.

### **2.4.3 Writing Your First Rust Program**

Open `src/main.rs` in VS Code. You should see the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `fn main()`: Defines the main function, the entry point of the program.
- `println!`: A macro that prints the specified string to the console.

### **2.4.4 Running the Program**

1. **Build and Run:**
   - In the terminal, execute:
     ```powershell
     cargo run
     ```

2. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (C:\Path\To\hello_world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.23s
     Running `target\debug\hello_world.exe`
   Hello, world!
   ```

**Explanation:**

- `cargo run` compiles the project and runs the resulting executable.
- The program outputs `Hello, world!` to the console.

### **2.4.5 Exploring `Cargo.toml`**

Open `Cargo.toml` to understand its structure:

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

**Sections:**

- `[package]`: Metadata about your project.
  - `name`: Project name.
  - `version`: Current version.
  - `edition`: Rust edition (e.g., 2015, 2018, 2021).

- `[dependencies]`: Lists project dependencies.
  - Initially empty; dependencies are added here as needed.

### **2.4.6 Adding a Dependency**

Let's add the popular `serde` crate for serialization.

1. **Add Dependency:**
   - Open `Cargo.toml`.
   - Under `[dependencies]`, add:
     ```toml
     serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
     ```

2. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Run:
     ```powershell
     cargo build
     ```
   - Cargo will download and compile the `serde` crate.

**Note:** Dependencies allow you to leverage existing libraries, enhancing your project's functionality.

Today, you've:

- **Learned** what Rust is, its history, and its use cases.
- **Set up** Rust using `rustup` on Windows.
- **Configured** Visual Studio Code with essential extensions for Rust development.
- **Created** your first Rust project using Cargo.

## Introduction to Loops in Rust

Loops are fundamental in programming, enabling repetitive execution of code blocks. Rust provides three primary looping constructs:

- `loop`: An unconditional, infinite loop.
- `while`: Repeats as long as a condition holds true.
- `for`: Iterates over elements of a collection or range.

Understanding when and how to use each loop type is crucial for writing efficient and readable Rust code.

---

## The `loop` Construct

The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop that runs until explicitly terminated with a `break` statement.

### Basic Usage

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("This will print forever!");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `loop` starts an infinite loop.
- `println!` outputs a message each iteration.
- Without a `break`, this loop never ends, leading to a program hang.

### Exiting a Loop with `break`

To exit a `loop`, use the `break` statement, optionally with a value.

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;

    loop {
        count += 1;
        println!("Count: {}", count);

        if count == 5 {
            break; // Exit the loop when count reaches 5
        }
    }

    println!("Loop ended after {} iterations.", count);
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
Loop ended after 5 iterations.
```

**Explanation:**

- The loop increments `count` each iteration.
- When `count` reaches 5, `break` terminates the loop.

### Returning Values from Loops

Loops can return values by assigning the result of a `break` statement.

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let result = loop {
        let number = rand::random::<u32>() % 10;

        if number > 5 {
            break number; // Return the number
        }
    };

    println!("Exited loop with number: {}", result);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The loop generates random numbers between 0 and 9.
- When a number greater than 5 is found, `break` returns it.
- The returned value is assigned to `result`.

---

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop runs as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`.

### Basic Usage

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;

    while count < 5 {
        println!("Count is: {}", count);
        count += 1;
    }

    println!("Finished counting to 5.");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Count is: 0
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Finished counting to 5.
```

**Explanation:**

- The loop condition checks if `count` is less than 5.
- The loop increments `count` each iteration until the condition is `false`.

### Example: Reading User Input

```rust:src/main.rs
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();

    println!("Type 'exit' to quit.");

    while input.trim() != "exit" {
        input.clear(); // Clear previous input
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut input)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        println!("You typed: {}", input.trim());
    }

    println!("Exited the loop.");
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The loop continues until the user types "exit".
- `input.clear()` resets the `String` for new input.
- `read_line` captures user input each iteration.

---

## The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over elements in a collection or range, providing a concise and safe way to handle iteration.

### Iterating Over Collections

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

    for fruit in &fruits {
        println!("I like {}", fruit);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
I like Apple
I like Banana
I like Cherry
```

**Explanation:**

- `&fruits` creates an iterator over references to the array elements.
- The loop prints each fruit in the collection.

### Using Ranges

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    for number in 1..5 {
        println!("Number: {}", number);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
```

**Explanation:**

- `1..5` is a range from 1 up to, but not including, 5.
- The loop iterates over each number in the range.

### Example: Iterating with References

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for num in &mut numbers {
        *num += 5; // Modify the actual element
    }

    println!("Updated numbers: {:?}", numbers);
}
```

**Output:**
```
Updated numbers: [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]
```

**Explanation:**

- `&mut numbers` creates a mutable iterator.
- The loop modifies each element by adding 5.
- The `*num` dereferences the mutable reference to modify the value.

---

## Handling References: `&`, `mut`, and `&mut`

In Rust, ownership and borrowing are core concepts that influence how data is accessed and modified. Understanding references (`&`), mutable references (`&mut`), and their usage within loops is essential for writing safe and efficient code.

### Immutable References (`&`)

An immutable reference allows you to read data without modifying it.

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

    for name in &names {
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `&names` borrows the vector immutably.
- The loop iterates over references, preventing ownership transfer.
- Data cannot be modified within the loop.

### Mutable References (`&mut`)

A mutable reference allows you to modify the borrowed data.

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut scores = vec![100, 200, 300];

    for score in &mut scores {
        *score += 50; // Mutate the actual value
    }

    println!("Updated scores: {:?}", scores);
}
```

**Output:**
```
Updated scores: [150, 250, 350]
```

**Explanation:**

- `&mut scores` borrows the vector mutably.
- The loop iterates with mutable references, allowing modification of each element.
- `*score` is used to dereference and mutate the value.

### When Not to Use References

Avoid unnecessary borrowing to maintain ownership semantics.

- **Ownership Transfer:** If you need to take ownership of data, avoid using references.
  
  ```rust:src/main.rs
  fn main() {
      let data = vec![1, 2, 3];

      for number in data { // Ownership is moved here
          println!("{}", number);
      }

      // println!("{:?}", data); // Error: data has been moved
  }
  ```

- **Mutable and Immutable References Conflict:** Rust enforces that you cannot have mutable and immutable references simultaneously to prevent data races.

  ```rust:src/main.rs
  fn main() {
      let mut items = vec![1, 2, 3];

      let first = &items[0]; // Immutable reference

      // let second = &mut items[1]; // Error: cannot borrow as mutable because it's already borrowed as immutable

      println!("First item: {}", first);
  }
  ```

**Best Practice:** Use references only when necessary to adhere to Rust's ownership rules and ensure memory safety.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

Adhering to best practices ensures that your Rust loops are efficient, safe, and maintainable.

### Avoiding Infinite Loops

Infinite loops can lead to unresponsive programs. Always ensure that your loop's exit condition is reachable.

**Bad Practice:**

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("This loop never ends!");
    }
}
```

**Good Practice:**

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    loop {
        counter += 1;
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);

        if counter >= 10 {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The loop terminates after `counter` reaches 10, preventing an infinite loop.

### Minimizing Mutable State

Excessive mutable state can lead to complex and error-prone code. Prefer immutable references when possible.

**Bad Practice:**

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];

    for i in 0..data.len() {
        data[i] += 1; // Mutable access
    }
}
```

**Good Practice:**

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];

    for num in &mut data {
        *num += 1; // Mutable access through reference
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Using `&mut data` with `for` provides a cleaner and safer way to mutate elements.

### Using Ownership Wisely

Understand Rust's ownership principles to manage data efficiently within loops.

**Example: Moving Ownership:**

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

    for name in names { // Moves ownership of each element
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }

    // println!("{:?}", names); // Error: names has been moved
}
```

**Solution: Borrow Instead of Move:**

```rust:src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

    for name in &names { // Borrows each element
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }

    println!("All names: {:?}", names); // Allowed
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Borrowing with `&names` allows the original vector to remain accessible after iteration.

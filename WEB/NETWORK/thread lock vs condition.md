Certainly! Let's break down the concept of `threading.Condition`, its purpose, and how it ensures thread safety, using analogies and comparisons to `threading.Event` and `threading.Lock`.

### Understanding `threading.Condition`

**Analogy**: Imagine a busy restaurant kitchen where chefs (threads) are preparing meals (tasks). The kitchen has a limited number of cooking stations (resources). When a chef wants to use a cooking station, they must first check if it’s available. If it’s occupied, they must wait until it’s free.

1. **Condition as a Waiting Room**: 
   - The `Condition` object acts like a waiting room in the kitchen. When a chef arrives and finds that all cooking stations are occupied, they go to the waiting room (call `wait()`) and wait until a station becomes available.
   - When a cooking station is freed up (the lock is released), the chef in the waiting room is notified (using `notify()`), allowing them to proceed to use the station.

2. **Thread Safety**: 
   - By acquiring the condition lock (`self._condition.acquire()`), the thread ensures that no other thread can modify the shared state (like the `_locked` variable) while it is checking or changing it. This prevents race conditions, where two threads might try to change the state at the same time, leading to inconsistent or incorrect behavior.
   - The condition lock ensures that the operations that check and modify the lock state are atomic (i.e., they complete without interruption), which is crucial for maintaining data integrity in a multithreaded environment.

### How `threading.Condition` Differs from `threading.Event` and `threading.Lock`

1. **`threading.Condition`**:
   - **Purpose**: Used for complex synchronization where threads need to wait for a specific condition to be met. It allows multiple threads to wait and be notified when they can proceed.
   - **Usage**: Threads can call `wait()` to block until they are notified. It is typically used in scenarios where one or more threads need to wait for a condition to change (like a resource becoming available).
   - **Example**: In a producer-consumer scenario, consumers wait for items to be produced, and producers notify consumers when items are available.

2. **`threading.Event`**:
   - **Purpose**: Used for simple signaling between threads. It allows one thread to signal one or more other threads that they can continue execution.
   - **Usage**: Threads can call `wait()` to block until the event is set. Once the event is set, all waiting threads are released.
   - **Example**: A worker thread might wait for a signal from a main thread to start processing data. The main thread sets the event when it’s ready.

3. **`threading.Lock`**:
   - **Purpose**: A basic locking mechanism that allows only one thread to access a resource at a time. It is used to protect shared resources from concurrent access.
   - **Usage**: Threads can call `acquire()` to lock the resource and `release()` to unlock it. If a thread tries to acquire a lock that is already held, it will block until the lock is released.
   - **Example**: A thread might lock a shared variable to update it, ensuring that no other thread can read or write to it simultaneously.

### Summary of Differences

|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Complex synchronization with waiting      | Simple signaling between threads          | Basic mutual exclusion for resource access |
| **Waiting Mechanism**  | Threads wait for a condition to be met    | Threads wait for an event to be set      | Threads block until the lock is available |
| **Notification**       | Uses `notify()` to wake waiting threads    | Uses `set()` to signal waiting threads    | No notification mechanism                  |
| **Use Case**           | Producer-consumer, resource availability   | Start/stop processing, simple signaling   | Protecting shared resources                 |

### Conclusion

In summary, `threading.Condition` is a powerful synchronization primitive that allows threads to wait for specific conditions while ensuring thread safety through the use of a condition lock. It is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple threads need to coordinate their actions based on shared state. Understanding the differences between `Condition`, `Event`, and `Lock` helps in choosing the right synchronization mechanism for your multithreaded applications.


----
Yes, you can think of `threading.Condition` as a more advanced synchronization primitive that builds upon the concepts of locks and provides additional functionality for managing thread coordination. However, it is not exactly "lower level" than `threading.Lock`; rather, it serves a different purpose and is used in different scenarios.

### Understanding the Relationship

1. **`threading.Lock`**:
   - A `Lock` is a basic synchronization primitive that provides mutual exclusion. It allows only one thread to access a resource at a time. When a thread acquires a lock, other threads that try to acquire the same lock will block until it is released.
   - It is straightforward and is used when you need to protect shared resources from concurrent access.

2. **`threading.Condition`**:
   - A `Condition` is built on top of a lock (internally, it uses a lock to manage access to its state). It allows threads to wait for certain conditions to be met and to notify other threads when those conditions change.
   - It provides a way for threads to wait for a signal (like a resource becoming available) and is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple threads need to coordinate their actions based on shared state.

### Why Use `threading.Condition`?

- **Complex Synchronization**: If you only need to protect a shared resource, a `Lock` is sufficient. However, if you have a scenario where threads need to wait for certain conditions (like a producer waiting for space in a buffer or a consumer waiting for items to be produced), a `Condition` is more appropriate.
- **Waiting and Notification**: `Condition` allows threads to wait and be notified when they can proceed, which is not something that a simple `Lock` can do. This makes `Condition` suitable for more complex interactions between threads.

### Direct Usage of `threading.Condition`

In the `CustomLock` implementation you provided earlier, we used `threading.Condition` directly to manage the waiting and notification of threads. Here’s how it works:

- **Acquiring the Condition**: When a thread wants to acquire the lock, it first acquires the condition lock. This ensures that the state of the lock (`_locked`) is checked and modified in a thread-safe manner.
- **Waiting for the Lock**: If the lock is already held, the thread calls `wait()` on the condition, which releases the condition lock and blocks the thread until it is notified.
- **Notifying Other Threads**: When the lock is released, the thread calls `notify()` on the condition to wake up one of the waiting threads, allowing it to attempt to acquire the lock.

### Summary

In summary, `threading.Condition` is not just a lower-level implementation of `Lock`; it is a higher-level synchronization primitive that provides additional functionality for managing thread coordination. While `Lock` is used for mutual exclusion, `Condition` is used for scenarios where threads need to wait for specific conditions and be notified when those conditions change. In your `CustomLock` implementation, you are indeed using `Condition` directly to manage the locking mechanism and thread synchronization.

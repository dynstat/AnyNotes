## 1. Introduction to Git

### What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development, facilitating collaboration, version tracking, and code management.

### Why Use Git?

- **Version Control**: Keeps a history of changes, enabling rollback to previous states.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project concurrently.
- **Branching**: Allows development of features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolated branches.
- **Distributed Nature**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, enhancing redundancy and speed.

### Git vs. Other Version Control Systems

| Feature         | Git                                     | Subversion (SVN)                        | Mercurial                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**| Distributed                             | Centralized                             | Distributed                             |
| **Performance** | Generally faster, especially for local operations | Slower due to centralized nature | Comparable to Git                           |
| **Branching**   | Lightweight and easy to manage          | More cumbersome and resource-heavy      | Lightweight but less flexible than Git  |
| **Popularity**  | Highly popular in open-source and industry | Less popular in modern development      | Moderately popular                      |

## 3. Basic Git Concepts

### Repository

A **Git repository** is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer or hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

- **Local Repository**: Stored on your machine.
- **Remote Repository**: Stored on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

### Commit

A **commit** is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and includes a commit message describing the changes.

### Branch

A **branch** is a parallel version of the repository. It allows you to work on different features or fixes independently.

- **Main (Master) Branch**: The primary branch where the source code is always in a deployable state.
- **Feature Branch**: Used to develop a specific feature or fix.

### Merge

**Merging** integrates changes from one branch into another, typically bringing feature branches into the main branch.

### Clone, Push, and Pull

- **Clone**: Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
- **Push**: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository.
- **Pull**: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into your local repository.

## 4. Working with Git Repositories

### Initializing a Repository

```bash
git init
```

**Explanation**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

### Cloning a Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url> [<directory>]
```

**Example**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

**Options**:
- `<directory>`: Optional. Specifies the local directory name.

### Adding Files to Staging

```bash
git add <file_path>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git add README.md
```

**Options**:
- `.`: Adds all changes in the current directory.
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

### Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

**Example**:
```bash
git commit -m "Add feature X"
```

**Options**:
- `-a`: Automatically stages files that have been modified and deleted.
  ```bash
  git commit -am "Update documentation"
  ```
- `--amend`: Modifies the most recent commit.
  ```bash
  git commit --amend -m "Correct commit message"
  ```

### Viewing Commit History

```bash
git log
```

**Options**:
- `--oneline`: Displays each commit on a single line.
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```
- `--graph`: Shows a text-based graphical representation of the branch structure.
  ```bash
  git log --graph --oneline
  ```

### Checking Repository Status

```bash
git status
```

**Explanation**: Shows the state of the working directory and staging area, indicating which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked.

### File Path: `.gitignore`

```plaintext
# .gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

node_modules/
dist/
.env
*.log
```

**Explanation**: Lists files and directories that Git should ignore. Useful for excluding build artifacts, dependencies, and sensitive information.

---

## 5. Git Branching and Merging

### Creating a New Branch

```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git branch feature-login
```

### Switching Branches

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

**Combined Command**: Create and switch to a new branch.
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

### Listing Branches

```bash
git branch
```

**Explanation**: Lists all local branches in the repository. The current branch is highlighted with an asterisk (*).

### Merging Branches

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

**Merge Types**:
- **Fast-Forward Merge**: If the main branch has not diverged, Git moves the main branch pointer forward.
- **Three-Way Merge**: If both branches have diverged, Git creates a merge commit to combine histories.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

When Git cannot automatically resolve differences, a merge conflict occurs.

**Steps to Resolve**:
1. **Identify Conflicted Files**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. **Edit Conflicted Files**: Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and resolve differences.
3. **Stage Resolved Files**:
   ```bash
   git add <file_path>
   ```
4. **Commit the Merge**:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

### Deleting a Branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git branch -d feature-login
```

**Options**:
- `-D`: Force deletion without checking merge status.
  ```bash
  git branch -D feature-login
  ```

### File Path: No specific file path, standard Git commands.

---

## 6. Undoing Changes and History Manipulation

### Undoing Unstaged Changes

```bash
git checkout -- <file_path>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout -- README.md
```

**Explanation**: Discards changes in the working directory for the specified file.

### Unstaging Changes

```bash
git reset <file_path>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git reset README.md
```

**Explanation**: Removes the specified file from the staging area without discarding changes.

### Undoing Commits

#### 1. Amending the Last Commit

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

**Explanation**: Replaces the most recent commit with a new commit, allowing you to modify the commit message or include new changes.

#### 2. Resetting to a Previous Commit

```bash
git reset --hard <commit_id>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git reset --hard a1b2c3d
```

**Explanation**: Moves the branch pointer to the specified commit, discarding all changes after it. **Use with caution** as it can lead to data loss.

**Options**:
- `--soft`: Moves the branch pointer but leaves the working directory and staging area unchanged.
  ```bash
  git reset --soft a1b2c3d
  ```
- `--mixed` (default): Moves the branch pointer and resets the staging area but leaves the working directory unchanged.
  ```bash
  git reset --mixed a1b2c3d
  ```

#### 3. Reverting a Commit

```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git revert a1b2c3d
```

**Explanation**: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit. This is safer for public branches as it doesn't alter history.

#### 4. Using `git reflog`

```bash
git reflog
```

**Explanation**: Shows a log of all actions (commits, resets, checkouts) performed in the repository, allowing recovery of lost commits.

**Example**:
```bash
git reflog
git checkout a1b2c3d
```

---

## 7. Collaborating with Teams

### Forking a Repository

**Procedure**:
1. **Navigate to the Original Repository** on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
2. **Click on "Fork"** to create a personal copy under your account.

### Cloning a Forked Repository

```bash
git clone <forked_repository_url>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
```

### Setting Up Remotes

By default, a cloned repository has a `origin` remote pointing to your fork. To keep track of the original repository, add an `upstream` remote.

```bash
git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originaluser/repo.git
```

**Verifying Remotes**:

```bash
git remote -v
```

**Sample Output**:
```bash
origin    https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/originaluser/repo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/originaluser/repo.git (push)
```

### Fetching and Merging Upstream Changes

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

**Explanation**: Updates your local `main` branch with changes from the original repository.

### Pushing Changes to Forked Repository

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git push origin feature-login
```

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Fork and Clone**: Create a personal fork and clone it locally.
2. **Create a Branch**: Develop feature or fix in a new branch.
3. **Commit and Push**: Commit changes and push the branch to your fork.
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)/Merge Request (MR)**: Propose your changes to the original repository.
5. **Review and Merge**: Repository maintainers review and merge your changes.

---

## 8. Working with Remote Repositories

### Adding a Remote

```bash
git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Removing a Remote

```bash
git remote remove <remote_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

### Renaming a Remote

```bash
git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
```

### Fetching from a Remote

```bash
git fetch <remote_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

**Explanation**: Retrieves updates from the remote repository without merging them.

### Pulling from a Remote

```bash
git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Explanation**: Fetches and merges changes from the remote branch into your current branch.

### Pushing to a Remote

```bash
git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git push origin feature-login
```

**Options**:
- `-u`: Sets the remote branch as the upstream reference.
  ```bash
  git push -u origin feature-login
  ```

### Setting Upstream Branch

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin feature-login
```

**Explanation**: Links your local branch with the remote branch, enabling easier push and pull commands.

### File Path: No specific file path, standard Git commands.

## 9. Handling Merge Requests

### What is a Merge Request (MR)?

A **Merge Request** (GitLab) or **Pull Request** (GitHub) is a feature that allows developers to notify team members of changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. It facilitates code review and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.

### Creating a Merge Request

1. **Push Your Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-login
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Repository** on GitHub or GitLab.
3. **Click on "Compare & Pull Request"** or "Create Merge Request".
4. **Fill in Details**:
   - **Title**: Concise description of the changes.
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation, including context and any relevant information.
5. **Assign Reviewers**: Select team members to review the code.
6. **Submit**: Create the Merge Request.

### Reviewing and Testing Merge Requests Locally

#### 1. Fetching the Merge Request

**GitHub Example**:
```bash
git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCH_NAME
```

**Example**:
```bash
git fetch origin pull/42/head:review-feature-login
```

**Explanation**: Fetches the merge request with ID 42 and creates a local branch `review-feature-login`.

**GitLab Example**:
- GitLab doesn't have a direct equivalent, but you can fetch branches similarly.
```bash
git fetch origin feature-login:review-feature-login
```

#### 2. Checking Out the Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout review-feature-login
```

#### 3. Running Tests Locally

Ensure that all automated tests pass on your local machine before merging.

```bash
git checkout review-feature-login
npm install
npm test
```

#### 4. Reviewing Code

- **Readability**: Ensure the code is clean and well-documented.
- **Functionality**: Verify that the feature works as intended.
- **Best Practices**: Check adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- **Security**: Look for potential security vulnerabilities.

#### 5. Approving and Merging

Once satisfied with the review:

1. **Approve the Merge Request** in the platform.
2. **Merge** the request:
   - **GitHub**: Click "Merge pull request".
   - **GitLab**: Click "Accept Merge Request".

### Accepting Merge Requests

#### Steps to Accept a Merge Request

1. **Review the Changes**: Go through the diff to understand what has been modified.
2. **Run Tests**: Execute tests to ensure changes don't break existing functionality.
3. **Discuss**: Leave comments for any required changes or improvements.
4. **Approve**: If everything is satisfactory, approve the request.
5. **Merge**:
   - **Squash and Merge**: Combines all commits into a single commit.
   - **Rebase and Merge**: Reapplies commits on top of the main branch.
   - **Merge Commit**: Keeps all commits as they are.

---

## 10. Best Practices

### 1. Commit Often with Descriptive Messages

**Example**:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix login issue by validating user input"
```

**Explanation**: Frequent commits make it easier to track changes and identify issues.

### 2. Use Branching Strategies

- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Create a branch for each new feature.
- **Gitflow Workflow**: A more structured approach with dedicated branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived branches directly merged into the main branch.

### 3. Keep the Main Branch Stable

Ensure that the main branch is always in a deployable state by thoroughly reviewing and testing changes before merging.

### 4. Write Clear and Concise Commit Messages

**Format**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

**Example**:
```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication

Implemented JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
```

**Explanation**: Clear commit messages improve readability and facilitate easier navigation through the project history.

### 5. Use `.gitignore` Effectively

Exclude files that should not be tracked, such as build artifacts, dependencies, and sensitive information.

**Example**:
```plaintext
# .gitignore
/node_modules
/dist
.env
*.log
```

### 6. Perform Code Reviews

Encourage thorough code reviews to maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch potential issues early.

### 7. Rebase for a Clean History

Use `git rebase` to maintain a linear commit history, making it easier to follow project evolution.

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout feature-login
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

**Explanation**: Rebasing applies your commits on top of the latest changes from the main branch.

### 8. Protect the Main Branch

Implement branch protection rules to prevent force pushes and direct commits, ensuring that all changes go through Merge Requests and reviews.

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### 1. Merge Conflicts

**Issue**: Occurs when changes from different branches conflict during merging.

**Solution**:
- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Regularly sync with the main branch.
  - Communicate with team members about overlapping work.
- **Resolving Conflicts**:
  1. **Identify Conflicted Files**:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
  2. **Edit Conflicted Files**: Resolve conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
  3. **Stage Resolved Files**:
     ```bash
     git add <file_path>
     ```
  4. **Commit the Merge**:
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

**Example**:
```bash
# After a merge conflict occurs
git status
# Edit conflicted-file.js to resolve conflicts
git add conflicted-file.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in conflicted-file.js"
```

### 2. Detached HEAD State

**Issue**: Occurs when `HEAD` is pointing directly to a commit rather than a branch.

**Solution**:
- **Check Current State**:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
- **Create a New Branch** from the detached state:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-branch-name
  ```

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout a1b2c3d
# Detached HEAD state
git checkout -b feature-temp
```

### 3. Accidental Commits to the Main Branch

**Issue**: Commit changes directly to the main branch when they should be in a feature branch.

**Solution**:
1. **Create a New Branch** from the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-login
   ```
2. **Move Commits** to the New Branch:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~n  # Remove last n commits from main
   git checkout feature-login
   git cherry-pick <commit_id>
   ```
3. **Force Push** (if necessary):
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

**Example**:
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature-login
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

**Note**: Force pushing can overwrite history; use with caution and inform your team.

### 4. Forgotten to Add Files Before Commit

**Issue**: Commit made without staging all intended files.

**Solution**:
1. **Stage the Missing Files**:
   ```bash
   git add <file_path>
   ```
2. **Amend the Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   ```

**Example**:
```bash
git add additional-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### 5. Pushing Sensitive Information

**Issue**: Accidentally commit and push sensitive data like passwords or API keys.

**Solution**:
1. **Remove the Sensitive Files**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached <file_path>
   ```
2. **Add to `.gitignore`**:
   ```plaintext
   # .gitignore
   secret.txt
   ```
3. **Rewrite History** (optional, for removing from all commits):
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file_path>' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
4. **Force Push**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   git push origin --force --tags
   ```

**Example**:
```bash
git rm --cached .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove .env file from repository"
git push origin main
```

**Note**: Use GitSecret or other tools for managing sensitive data securely.

### 6. Large Files in Repository

**Issue**: Accidentally commit large files, leading to performance issues.

**Solution**:
1. **Identify Large Files**:
   ```bash
   git rev-list --objects --all | sort -k 2 > allfiles.txt
   ```
2. **Use Git Large File Storage (LFS)**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.psd"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add <large_file>
   git commit -m "Add large file with Git LFS"
   git push origin main
   ```

**Example**:
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.zip"
git add .gitattributes
git add large-archive.zip
git commit -m "Add large archive with Git LFS"
git push origin main
```

---

## 12. Advanced Git Topics

### 1. Rebasing

**Purpose**: Reapply commits on top of another base tip, creating a linear history.

```bash
git checkout feature-login
git rebase main
```

**Explanation**: Moves the `feature-login` branch to start from the latest commit on `main`, replaying its commits.

**Interactive Rebase**:

```bash
git rebase -i <base_commit>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

**Explanation**: Allows editing, reordering, squashing, or dropping commits interactively.

### 2. Cherry-Picking

**Purpose**: Apply specific commits from one branch to another.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit_id>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d
```

**Explanation**: Applies the changes introduced by commit `a1b2c3d` to the current branch.

### 3. Stashing

**Purpose**: Save uncommitted changes temporarily without committing them.

```bash
git stash
```

**Options**:
- `git stash save "message"`: Saves with a descriptive message.
- `git stash list`: Lists all stashed changes.
- `git stash apply [stash@{n}]`: Applies a specific stash.
- `git stash pop`: Applies and removes the latest stash.

**Example**:
```bash
git stash save "WIP on feature-login"
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{0}
git stash pop
```

### 4. Git Hooks

**Purpose**: Automate tasks by triggering scripts at certain points in the Git workflow.

**Common Hooks**:
- `pre-commit`: Runs before a commit is created.
- `post-commit`: Runs after a commit is created.
- `pre-push`: Runs before pushing to a remote.

**Example**:

**File Path**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Pre-commit hook to run tests before committing

npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

**Explanation**: Prevents committing if tests fail.

**Enable Hook**:
- Make the hook executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
  ```

### 5. Git Submodules

**Purpose**: Include and track external repositories within a parent repository.

```bash
git submodule add <repository_url> <path>
```

**Example**:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/example/library.git libs/library
```

**Managing Submodules**:

- **Cloning with Submodules**:
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules <repository_url>
  ```
- **Updating Submodules**:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --remote
  ```

### 6. Git Bisect

**Purpose**: Identify the commit that introduced a bug using binary search.

**Steps**:
1. **Start Bisect**:
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   ```
2. **Mark Good Commit**:
   ```bash
   git bisect good <commit_id>
   ```
3. **Mark Bad Commit**:
   ```bash
   git bisect bad <commit_id>
   ```
4. **Test and Mark**:
   ```bash
   git bisect good
   # or
   git bisect bad
   ```
5. **Finish Bisect**:
   ```bash
   git bisect reset
   ```

**Example**:
```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0
# Git checks out a commit for testing
# After testing:
git bisect good
# or
git bisect bad
# Repeat until the problematic commit is found
git bisect reset
```

   ```

3. **Make Changes**:
   - **Edit `app.js`** to add login functionality.

   **File Path**: `./app.js`

   ```javascript
   // app.js: Adds login functionality

   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.use(express.json());

   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
     const { username, password } = req.body;
     // Simple authentication logic
     if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password') {
       res.status(200).send('Login successful');
     } else {
       res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
     }
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`App running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

4. **Stage and Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add app.js
   git commit -m "feat(login): add login endpoint"
   ```

5. **Push the Feature Branch to Remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-add-login
   ```

6. **Create a Merge Request**:
   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub or GitLab.
   - Click on "Compare & Pull Request" or "Create Merge Request".
   - Fill in the title and description.
   - Assign reviewers.
   - Submit the Merge Request.

7. **Review and Merge**:
   - Reviewers fetch the branch, test changes, and leave feedback.
   - Once approved, merge the request into the `main` branch.

**Explanation**: This project guides you through the process of creating a feature branch, making changes, committing, pushing, and submitting a Merge Request for collaborative review and integration.

## 2. Undoing Commits and Managing History

**Objective**: Practice undoing commits using various methods and understanding their impacts.

### Steps:

1. **View Commit History**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

## 4. Reviewing and Testing Merge Requests Locally

**Objective**: Learn how to review and test Merge Requests locally before merging.

### Steps:

1. **Fetch the Merge Request**:

   **GitHub Example**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin pull/<PR_number>/head:review-pr-<PR_number>
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin pull/42/head:review-pr-42
   ```

   **GitLab Example**:
   - GitLab assigns unique URLs or use branch names accordingly.
   ```bash
   git fetch origin merge-request/<MR_number>/head:review-mr-<MR_number>
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin merge-request/42/head:review-mr-42
   ```

2. **Checkout the Review Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout review-pr-42
   ```

3. **Run Tests Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   ```

4. **Review Code Changes**:
   - Manually inspect the code for quality, security, and adherence to project standards.
   - Use Visual Studio Code's diff tools for side-by-side comparison.

5. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Leave comments or request changes in the Merge Request interface.
   - Suggest improvements or highlight issues.

6. **Approve and Merge**:
   - If satisfied, approve the Merge Request.
   - Merge through the GitHub or GitLab interface or via command line (if permissions allow).

**Example**:

```bash
# Fetch and checkout the Merge Request
git fetch origin pull/42/head:review-pr-42
git checkout review-pr-42

# Run tests
npm install
npm test

# After successful review
git checkout main
git merge review-pr-42
git push origin main
```

**Explanation**: This process ensures that Merge Requests are thoroughly reviewed and tested locally before being integrated into the main branch, maintaining code quality and project integrity.

## 14. Best Practices

### 1. Write Meaningful Commit Messages

**Structure**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

**Example**:
```
fix(auth): handle null password input

Added validation to ensure that password fields are not null before processing authentication.
```

**Explanation**: Clear and structured commit messages improve readability and facilitate easier navigation of the project history.

### 2. Use Branching Strategies

- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Develop each feature in its own branch.
- **Gitflow Workflow**: A predefined branching model with support for hotfixes and releases.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived branches merged frequently into the main branch.

**Example**: Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature-add-logout
```

### 3. Keep the Repository Clean

- **Regularly Remove Unnecessary Branches**:
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature-old
  git push origin --delete feature-old
  ```
- **Use `.gitignore`**: Exclude files that shouldn't be tracked.

### 4. Protect Your Main Branch

- **Enable Branch Protection Rules**: Prevent direct pushes and enforce code reviews.
- **Require Status Checks**: Ensure that all tests pass before merging.

### 5. Sync Regularly with the Main Branch

- **Fetch and Merge**:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git checkout main
  git merge origin/main
  ```
- **Rebase Your Feature Branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout feature-add-login
  git rebase main
  ```

### 6. Use Tags for Releases

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Explanation**: Tags mark specific points in the repository's history as being important, such as release points.

### 7. Handle Large Files with Git LFS

**Installation**:
```bash
git lfs install
```

**Tracking a File Type**:
```bash
git lfs track "*.psd"
```

**Explanation**: Git Large File Storage (LFS) manages large files efficiently by storing them outside the repository.

### 8. Automate Workflows with Git Hooks

**Example**:
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Run linters before committing.
  
  **File Path**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

  ```bash
  #!/bin/sh
  # Pre-commit hook to run ESLint

  npm run lint
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Linting failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

  **Enable the Hook**:
  ```bash
  chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
  ```

## 15. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### 1. Stuck in Merge Conflicts

**Issue**: Unable to resolve merge conflicts, leading to a stuck repository state.

**Solution**:
- **Abort the Merge**:
  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  ```
- **Use Visual Tools**: Utilize Git integration in Visual Studio Code to resolve conflicts graphically.
- **Seek Assistance**: Collaborate with team members to resolve complex conflicts.

### 2. Lost Commits

**Issue**: Commits appear to be missing after performing resets or rebases.

**Solution**:
- **Use `git reflog`** to find the lost commits:
  ```bash
  git reflog
  ```
- **Recover the Commit**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit_id>
  ```

**Example**:
```bash
git reflog
git checkout -b recovered-feature a1b2c3d
```

### 3. Accidental `git push --force`

**Issue**: Force-pushing overwrites remote history, affecting collaborators.

**Solution**:
- **Contact Collaborators**: Inform them about the force push.
- **Use `git reflog`** to recover the overwritten commits.
- **Avoid Using `--force`**: Prefer `--force-with-lease` to minimize risk.
  ```bash
  git push --force-with-lease
  ```

### 4. Detached HEAD State

**Issue**: Working in a detached `HEAD` state and making commits that are not referenced by any branch.

**Solution**:
- **Create a New Branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-branch
  ```
- **Merge or Rebase as Needed**.

### 5. Ignoring Files Didn't Work

**Issue**: Files listed in `.gitignore` are still being tracked.

**Solution**:
- **Remove Files from Tracking**:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached <file_path>
  ```
- **Commit the Changes**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Stop tracking <file_path>"
  ```

**Example**:
```bash
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Stop tracking .env file"
```

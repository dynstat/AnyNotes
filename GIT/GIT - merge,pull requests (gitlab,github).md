#### **GitLab MRs in VS Code**
1. **Install Extension**: Use extensions like [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow).
2. **View MRs**: Access MRs through the extension panel.
3. **Review Changes**: Inspect diffs, add comments, and approve or request modifications.

## 3. **Testing the Changes Locally**

Before merging, it's crucial to **test the changes** to ensure they work as expected.

1. **Checkout the PR/MR Branch Locally**
    ```bash
    # GitHub
    git fetch origin pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head:<LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME>
    git checkout <LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME>

    # GitLab
    git fetch origin merge-requests/<MR_NUMBER>/head:<LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME>
    git checkout <LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME>
    ```

2. **Run Tests**
    - Execute your project's test suite to verify functionality.
    - Perform manual testing if necessary.

## Using Git Command-Line Interface

### Step 1: Fetch the Pull Request

First, you need to fetch the PR from the remote repository. GitHub assigns a unique number to each PR, which you'll use to fetch it.

```bash
git fetch origin pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head:<LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME>
```

**Example:**

If the PR number is `42` and you want to name your local branch `pr-42-review`, the command would be:

```bash
git fetch origin pull/42/head:pr-42-review
```

### Step 2: Create and Checkout a New Branch

After fetching, switch to the newly created branch to start reviewing the changes.

```bash
git checkout <LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout pr-42-review
```

### Step 3: Review and Test the Changes

Now that you're on the PR branch, you can:

- **Review the Code**: Inspect the changes using `git diff`, your IDE, or any other tool.
  
  ```bash
  git diff main..pr-42-review
  ```
  
- **Run Tests**: Execute the project's test suite to ensure everything works as expected.

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  
- **Manual Testing**: Run the application locally to manually verify the new features or fixes.

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Make Adjustments**: If necessary, make changes and commit them to the PR branch.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Reviewed and added improvements to PR #42"
  git push origin pr-42-review
  ```
